<p class="p2">The sea is a stern mistress. She demands
from her sons both vigilance and skill in
her service, and for the man who fails her the
penalty is death. From generation to generation
men have faced and fought the same
dangers in every ocean. Going down to the
sea in ships from a thousand different ports, the
mariners of the world have triumphed or died
like their fathers before them, in the face of
dangers as old as the world itself. And because
they have braved the same perils, seamen
of all nations have been united in a splendid
fellowship, which is called the Brotherhood
of the Sea. The mariner in danger who sent
out a call for help could count on assistance
from his brother of the sea, regardless of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
nationality; while with the advance of science
and coming of wireless telegraphy, the scope of
such mutual assistance became more and more
extended. Without hesitation men turned
their ships from their intended course, on
receiving the S.O.S. signal, and sped for
miles to the help of their unfortunate
brothers.</p>

<p>It bound men together, this Brotherhood
of the Sea, in a way never fully to be comprehended
by landsmen. It was a fine, manly
freemasonry, and demanded from its members
those qualities of courage, honour, and
chivalry which are the true seaman&rsquo;s heritage.
Not until the coming of the German
submarine commander was the Brotherhood
of the Sea destroyed.</p>

<p>The following accounts of German submarine
exploits have been compiled from
British Admiralty documents and the sworn
statements of survivors. Each story is a
plain statement of fact. They are, of course,
merely a selection, but they show quite clearly
the lines upon which the German submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
campaign has been conducted from the beginning
of the war up to the latter part of 1917.</p>

<p>It is only right that the tale of these
sinkings should be widely known, because
only by knowing what has actually taken
place can a true opinion be formed about the
German submariner and his work. For this
reason, the following accounts have been set
down as simply as possible, without exaggeration
or unfair comment.</p>

<p>The German submarine commanders
were sent to sea in order to sink ships,
because Germany believed unrestricted U-boat
warfare a necessity; but they received orders,
according to the Berlin Government, that
human life and the rights of neutrals were to
be respected. The way in which these orders
were carried out is shown in the following
pages.</p>

THE PIRATE AS THIEF.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>If Fate has selected us to assume the leadership in
the Kultur-life of the peoples, we will not shrink from this
great and lofty mission.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gustav E. Pazanrek.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The Dutch steamer <i>Gamma</i> was proceeding
from New York to Amsterdam on the
1st February, 1917, with a cargo of oilcake
for the Netherlands Government. At 2.30 p.m.
a German submarine appeared on the port
bow, steering towards the ship. Without
making any signal, the submarine at once
opened fire. She fired six shells, one of which
struck the windlass. The ship was stopped,
boats were lowered, and the master proceeded
to the submarine, where he was questioned by
the commander. A German officer and two men
boarded the <i>Gamma</i>, placed bombs in her holds,
and returned with a bag of flour, two hams, some
butter, and a few engine-room tools. The master
asked for a tow, but this was refused, and the
submarine disappeared. Ten minutes later the
bombs exploded and the <i>Gamma</i> went down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
It was bitterly cold, but fortunately the boats
were picked up by the Dutch liner <i>Vondel</i> at
about 6 o&rsquo;clock that night.</p>

<p>The <i>Gamma</i> was a neutral vessel laden with
cargo for a neutral Government, but the fact was
totally disregarded by the Germans. Fire was
opened recklessly and without warning, and it
was merely a matter of chance that no lives were
lost. Having looted the vessel in true pirate
style, the Germans refused the Dutchmen a tow.
Once more it was only through good fortune that
their boat happened to be picked up before any of
the crew had died from exposure. The Germans
showed themselves to be arbitrary, discourteous,
and robbers.</p>

<p>At 12.15 p.m. on the 2nd February, 1917, a
U-boat suddenly appeared alongside the Russian
sailing vessel <i>Garnet Hill</i> and ordered the crew
to abandon the ship at once. When this had
been done, bombs were placed in the vessel, which
sank in about five minutes after the explosion.
The Germans took the master&rsquo;s chronometer and
a lot of clothes. They also took off one member
of the crew who declared himself to be a German.
The boats were picked up 28 hours later.</p>

<p>This is a case that gives one an insight into
German methods, and suggests the possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of the seaman as spy. Obviously these possibilities
are very great, although we cannot say for
certain to what extent the services of the seaman-spy
have been utilised by Germany in her submarine
campaign. Many a ship may have been
betrayed by Germans masquerading under some
other nationality. The idea of the sea-spy is so
essentially Teutonic that it must have been
exploited by the Berlin Government. Thus,
although the <i>Garnet Hill</i> provides an instance
of the Pirate as Thief, it is perhaps more interesting
as an instance of the Pirate as Spy.</p>

<p>The British trawler <i>Romeo</i> was sunk by a
German submarine at 2 p.m. on the 3rd February,
1917. Before sinking her the Germans ransacked
the vessel and took away her ensign, ship&rsquo;s stores,
clocks, weather-glasses, the clothes of the crew,
and the skipper&rsquo;s kit. The crew were picked up
by a patrol-boat at 5 p.m. the same day.</p>

<p>On the 4th February, 1917, at 6 p.m. the
British steamship <i>Dauntless</i> was struck on the
funnel by a shot. The master at once gave the
order &ldquo;Hard a-starboard,&rdquo; but before it could be
executed a shell struck the bridge, damaging the
steering-gear and wounding the master and the
man at the wheel. Shells began to fly over the
ship, the engines were stopped, and both life-boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
were lowered. One fireman was killed on deck,
but the rest of the crew reached the boats in
safety, although firing was continued all this
time. When the starboard life-boat had got a
little way from the ship the submarine appeared
alongside and ordered all hands on board. The
lifeboat was then manned by Germans, who
proceeded to the vessel, presently returning with
various tinned provisions, some turpentine, and
enamel, which were taken on board the submarine.
They had also brought away the ship&rsquo;s jolly-boat.</p>

<p>At about 8.10 p.m. the sound of a muffled explosion
was heard, and the crew were then ordered
into their boats, the submarine disappearing in
the darkness. The master and six men entered
the jolly-boat, the remaining nine men taking to
the life-boat. Soon afterwards the two boats
became separated in the darkness.</p>

<p>They rowed the jolly-boat all through the night,
and at 6 a.m. next day the steward died from
exposure. His body was thrown overboard at
6 o&rsquo;clock that evening. Land was then visible,
but a snow-storm came on, and land was lost.
They rowed all through the night, but on Tuesday
morning land was sighted again, and at 10 a.m.
the boat touched the beach and was overturned
by breakers. The remaining six men managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to get ashore, but soon after landing the second
engineer and a fireman died on the beach. The
four survivors were taken to hospital, and on 12th
February the mate and chief and second engineers
were discharged. The master was left behind,
suffering from exposure and shell wounds.</p>

<p>At 12.50 p.m., in very thick weather, on
the 9th February, the British trawler <i>Benbow</i>
was fired upon by a German submarine. As the
fog lifted two shots were fired, followed by four
more while the boat was being got out. The
crew were transferred to the submarine while a
party of Germans visited the trawler. They
returned with 5 stone of flour, 3 tins of treacle,
4 stone of sugar, half-a-dozen boxes of Quaker
oats, 3 barrels of meat, 10 lbs. of sausages,
several tins of milk, 2 clocks, and the kits of the
skipper and chief engineer. When the submarine
was last seen the clothes were being divided
amongst the Germans. The trawler was sunk by
a bomb; the submarine disappeared in the fog.</p>

<p>On the same day the British trawler <i>Athenian</i>
was attacked by a U-boat, seven or eight shots
being fired while her boat was being got out.
Everything portable was taken from the trawler
by the Germans. After she had been sunk, the
German commander asked the skipper whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
he would like to go to Germany or remain in his
open boat. The skipper chose his boat. The
men were picked up at 2 p.m. next day.</p>

<p>At 12.30 p.m. on the 10th February, 1917, the
master of the British trawler <i>Ireland</i> was towing
his trawl at a speed of 2½ miles an hour when he
sighted a German submarine 2½ miles away on
the port side. The submarine fired a shot which
dropped 2 yards clear of the trawler&rsquo;s stern.
Her boat was at once got out, two more shots
being fired, one of which dropped just astern,
while the other passed over the funnel. The
crew embarked in their boat without casualties,
and the Germans then looted the trawler,
taking away the ship&rsquo;s papers, sextant, binoculars,
fisherman&rsquo;s almanack, and a basket of provisions.
They sank the trawler at about 1 p.m.
The crew were picked up by a patrol-boat at
6 a.m. on the 14th February, and landed at
Scarborough at 8 o&rsquo;clock that night, when two
of them were sent to hospital suffering from
frost-bite.</p>

<p>The British steamer <i>Margarita</i> was sunk by a
U-boat in the evening of the 14th February, 1917,
after being looted by the Germans. They took
the clocks from the engine-room and cabin, the
barometer, some condensed milk, and some soap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
The crew were picked up at 3.15 a.m. next day
and landed at Milford Haven.</p>

<p>The British sailing vessel <i>Invercauld</i> was sunk
on the 22nd February by a German submarine,
which opened fire on her without warning. After
firing a torpedo, which struck the ship on the
port beam, blowing away 150 feet of her side, the
Germans boarded her and searched for food.
However, the water was too high for this, so the
commander contented himself by taking the
chronometer, binoculars, clocks, bell, ensign, and
other portable articles, for which he gave the
master a receipt. The master and his crew of
23 hands escaped without casualty.</p>

<p>On the 17th March, 1917, two German submarines
attacked and sank four Portuguese
fishing vessels, the <i>Rita Segunda</i>, <i>Flor de Abril</i>,
<i>Senora del Rosario</i>, and <i>Restaurador</i>. One man
of the <i>Restaurador</i> was killed and three others
injured, although the crews left their vessels
after the first shot. On the 19th March the
following official statement was issued in Lisbon:</p>

<p>&ldquo;While four trawlers were fishing off the coast of
Algarvo, the most southerly province of Portugal,
two German submarines made their appearance,
one from the north and the other from the south.
They immediately opened fire upon the fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
vessels. The crews were ordered to leave their
ships, which were then looted by the Germans
of the fish and clothing they had on board. The
trawlers were then sunk. One of the fishermen
was killed and three were seriously wounded.
The remainder of the crews, to the number of
about 100, have been safely landed at Lisbon
by patrol-boats of the Portuguese Naval
Division.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 3rd May, 1917, nine or ten Irish fishing
vessels were looted and destroyed by German
submarines at about 8 p.m. The skipper of one
of these vessels, the <i>Lucky Lass</i>, has described
how the Germans took his new foresail, fishing
lines, clothes, oilskins, and his son&rsquo;s watch. They
then smashed up the <i>Lucky Lass</i> with a large
hatchet and a big stone hammer. They were in
a great hurry, and ordered the skipper and his son
to keep a sharp look-out for British patrol-boats
during their looting operations. Another boat,
the <i>Sir Edward Birbeck</i>, was sunk by bombs.</p>

<p>The British sailing ship <i>Alfred</i> was sunk on
the 12th June. The Germans looted the vessel,
carrying off the stores and all her brass-work.
The crew were taken on board the submarine and
then witnessed the sinking of another vessel.
They saw dead bodies and struggling men in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
water, while the officers and crew of the
submarine sneered and laughed at them.</p>

<p>The Swedish steamer <i>Snetoppen</i> was bound for
New York on the 4th July, 1917, when a submarine
came to the surface on her starboard bow
and commenced to shell her. After half-a-dozen
shots had been fired the master decided that his
position was hopeless, and gave orders to abandon
ship in two boats.</p>

<p>The Germans then proceeded to loot the steamer,
taking the ship&rsquo;s chronometer and barometer,
two sextants, and three boat-loads of provisions.
The German sailors ransacked the state-rooms,
while their officers demanded whiskey, beer, and
cognac, besides taking all the clothes they could
lay hands on. They sank the steamer with bombs,
and left the survivors in their boats. These
were afterwards picked up by an American
destroyer.</p>

<p>With regard to these cases, it would probably
be contended by the Germans that the sufferings
of the <i>Dauntless&rsquo;</i> survivors were unavoidable.
But what about the shelling of the vessel? This
was wholly unnecessary, and resulted in the death
of one man. The Germans could have committed
their thefts of provisions, turpentine and enamel
without first shelling the ship. To the lesser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
crime of theft they need not have added the
greater crime of murder.</p>

<p>In the same way, the shelling of the British
trawlers was totally uncalled for; and since it is
not to be supposed that the German fires merely
for the amusement of discharging his guns,
another conclusion is forced upon us. It will be
noticed that shots were fired while the boats were
being lowered in the cases of the <i>Dauntless</i>,
<i>Benbow</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>. With what object, except
to take life? Upon the occasions under review
the German missed his mark; but this does not
always happen, as the study of other cases will
show.</p>

<p>Apart from the firing, the examples quoted
show the German as thief, although in the sinking
of the <i>Invercauld</i> the pirates defeated their own
ends, so far as food was concerned. The giving
of a receipt for the articles taken was in accordance
with the German Prize Regulations, which lay
down that: &ldquo;H.M. ships can, in case of need,
replenish from the cargo and from the non-consumable
and consumable stores of captured
enemy ships (a receipt being given for anything
taken) if the articles are not proved beyond doubt
to be neutral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The incidents connected with the sinking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the <i>Alfred</i> make one speculate as to the standard
by which German naval officers regulate their
conduct. It is inconceivable that any British
commander would allow his men to laugh and
sneer at a number of hapless seamen struggling
in the water. This German officer, however, did
not hesitate to do so.</p>

<p>The looting of the Swedish steamer <i>Snetoppen</i>
is interesting in view of the regulation above
quoted in connection with the <i>Invercauld</i>. It
is a case of the Pirate as Thief amongst neutrals.
The Germans behaved like common housebreakers,
and showed the same spirit which their
comrades of the German Army exhibited early in
the war, when they ransacked chateaux and
private houses during their first advance.</p>

<p>It will be in place here to glance at other
provisions contained in the German Naval
Prize Regulations. These should be borne in
mind when reading about the actual deeds of the
German submarine officers here collected. The
Regulations were published in the <i>Reichs-Gesetzblatt</i>
at Berlin on the 3rd August, 1914. The
first of the &ldquo;General Provisions&rdquo; reads:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commanding officers of H.M. warships
have the right during a war, in accordance with
the following provisions, to stop enemy or neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
merchant ships, to search and capture them as
well as the enemy and neutral goods in them,
and in exceptional cases to destroy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the General Provisions states:&mdash;&ldquo;All
measures are to be carried out in a manner
the observance of which&mdash;even towards the
enemy&mdash;is demanded by the honour of the German
Empire, and with such consideration for neutrals
as is in accordance with international law and
German interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clause 6 sets out the vessels that are exempt
from capture. These include: &ldquo;Hospital ships,
vessels employed exclusively in coast fisheries, or
small boats employed in local trade, so long as
they do not take any part whatever in
hostilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two clauses dealing with ships which
endeavour to escape. The first states that: &ldquo;A
neutral ship is to be treated as an enemy ship
if she forcibly resists the exercise of the right of
stoppage, search, and capture; force may be used
against the ship in question until she ceases to
resist; attempted flight alone does not count as
forcible resistance.&rdquo; On the other hand, Article
83 declares: &ldquo;If the ship does not stop when
signalled, two rounds of blank are to be fired,
one after the other; and, if necessary, a live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
shell across her bows. If the vessel does not
then bring to, or offers resistance, the commander
will compel her to stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No excuse can be made for the German commanders,
in view of these regulations. Their
Government ordered them to behave in the
manner demanded by the honour of the German
Empire, and in accordance with international
law and German interests. Their conduct has
shown the world the meaning of the word
&ldquo;honour,&rdquo; as understood within the German
Empire. For international law, of course, they
have never attempted to show the slightest
respect; but it is possible that they really believed
they were serving German interests by behaving
as bloodthirsty pirates. The mad doctrine of
&ldquo;frightfulness&rdquo; which has been preached to
Young Germany from a thousand pulpits and in a
thousand schools all over the Central Empire, has
killed all sense of morality in the modern Teuton.
The German thinks he can terrorise the world
by acts of mere savagery: this is the deadly
error which has cut his country off from the
civilised nations of the globe.</p>

THE PIRATE AS MURDERER.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The German is a hero born, and believes that he
can hack and hew his way through life.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Heinrich v. Treitschke.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">In February, 1915, Germany declared a
blockade of Great Britain and Ireland.
Her official declaration stated, amongst other
things, that from February 18th every
hostile merchant ship found in the waters around
the British Isles would be destroyed, &ldquo;even if
it is not always possible to avoid dangers which
thereby threaten the crews and passengers.&rdquo;
Neutral ships were also warned that they would
incur danger in the &ldquo;military area,&rdquo; because,
according to Germany, the British Government
had issued orders as to the misuse of neutral flags
at sea. This accusation was false; no misuse
of neutral flags has ever been ordered by the
British Government. Traffic northwards round
the Shetland Islands was graciously permitted
by the Germans in their Note.</p>

<p>That Germany could enforce an effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
blockade of the British Isles was not to be expected,
but the Berlin Press hailed the Imperial
Government&rsquo;s declaration with delight. The
<i>Lokal-Anzeiger</i>, a semi-official journal, exclaimed:
&ldquo;What do we care about the outcry of others and
the indignation of our enemies? We Germans
have a great lesson to learn from this war, namely,
not to be fastidious and not to listen to others.&rdquo;
Both these lessons appear to have been thoroughly
mastered. In the <i>Kreuz-Zeitung</i>, the official
organ of the Conservative and Court parties, the
following comment appeared: &ldquo;It appears that
we shall now torpedo ships without previous
warning. For the first time we appear now to
have decided on this relentless form of warfare.
We welcome with satisfaction the fact that our
submarines will wage the most ruthless and
relentless war against all enemy shipping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the term &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; is liable to misinterpretation,
we cannot do better than quote the German
definition of a blockade, as contained in the
German Naval Prize Regulations, Section V.,
Articles 58, 59, and 60.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blockade must be confined to the ports
and coasts belonging to or occupied by the enemy;
the blockading forces must not bar access to
neutral ports or coasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A blockade, in order to be valid, must be
effective, applied impartially, and declared and
notified according to the rules concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A blockade is really effective when it is
maintained by a force sufficient to prevent access
to the enemy coast. The question whether a
blockade is effective as to number and disposition
of the blockading forces under the existing
geographical conditions must in every case be
examined by the Prize Court. Among other
things, it will be denied if maritime traffic could
be maintained between one of the blockaded ports
and any port not blockaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The absurdity of the German declaration
becomes clear in the light of Germany&rsquo;s own
official description of an effective blockade. It is
now over two years since she essayed to blockade
the British Isles; but never during the whole of
that period has she been able to provide a &ldquo;force
sufficient to prevent access to the enemy coast.&rdquo;
Moreover, during the same period maritime
traffic has been &ldquo;maintained between blockaded
and unblockaded ports.&rdquo; The whole affair quickly
developed into a series of piratical raids by
submarines against the sea-borne commerce of
the world, carried out in a spirit of reckless
brutality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The German&rsquo;s utter disregard even for the
rules laid down by his own Admiralty horrified
the world and destroyed the reputation
and honour of the German Navy. This can
scarcely be considered surprising, when we remember
that the following are but a few examples
of the German submariner&rsquo;s methods.</p>

<p>On the 27th March, 1915, at about 5.30 p.m.
the s.s. <i>Aguila</i>, when signalled to stop by a
submarine, put on full speed to escape. She was,
however, overhauled, the submarine approaching
to within about 300 feet of her, and opening fire
with shrapnel and solid shot. The chief engineer
was killed, and the master, third engineer, and a
fireman were wounded. At 6 p.m. the engines
were stopped, and as way came off the ship, the
boats were lowered; but the submarine continued
to fire, killing the boatswain, donkeyman,
stewardess, and a lady passenger, and wounding
others. One of the boats capsized, which brought
the total death-roll up to eight. The position
was 33 miles from land. The submarine offered
no assistance, and went away after sinking the
ship.</p>

<p>On the 28th March, 1915, the s.s. <i>Falaba</i>, of
4,806 tons, was overhauled after a short chase
by an enemy submarine about 60 miles west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
St. Ann&rsquo;s Head. The submarine hailed the ship
through a megaphone to &ldquo;take to the boats, as
they were going to sink the ship in five minutes.&rdquo;
This was at noon, and ten minutes later the
submarine fired a torpedo from a distance of about
100 yards. The <i>Falaba</i> took a list to starboard
and sank in 8 minutes.</p>

<p>The steamer carried a crew of 95 and
147 passengers, including seven women, a
total of 242 persons; and it was quite
impossible to transfer this number of people to
the boats in the twenty minutes that elapsed
between the submarine&rsquo;s warning and the sinking
of the ship. While the boats were being launched
at top speed, the falls of one boat slipped, the falls
of another jammed, some boats were dashed
against the side of the ship, and one was seriously
injured by the explosion of the torpedo. The
result was that 104 lives were lost, 138 being
saved.</p>

<p>This heavy loss of life was quite unnecessary,
and would never have occurred if the German
commander had allowed the master a reasonable
time in which to abandon ship. We are entitled
to claim that the sinking of the <i>Falaba</i>, carried
out as it was, amounted to nothing less than an
act of murder. This is true, because the safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of the U-boat did not depend upon the immediate
sinking of the steamer, which could have been
destroyed just as effectually without the loss of a
single life.</p>

<p>On the 1st June, 1915, at about 4.30 p.m., the
trawler <i>Victoria</i> endeavoured to escape from a
submarine; but after being badly damaged and
losing one of her crew by shell-fire, the vessel
was hove to. The submarine was only 200 yards
away, but she continued to fire, killing five men
and wounding a sixth, although the trawler had
surrendered.</p>

<p>The spirit of the German submariner is here
illustrated. Because a vessel, very naturally,
tries to escape, she is submitted to shell-fire after
giving in, and unnecessary loss of life is inflicted.
The German commander apparently derived
satisfaction from this shelling of an unarmed
craft while stationary, but to ordinary men his
action will seem inhuman and cruel.</p>

<p>At 2.15 p.m. on the 9th July, 1915, a shot was
fired at the s.s. <i>Meadowfield</i> by a submarine.
Immediately afterwards, while the master was
looking round to see from whence the shot had
come, a second was fired and the man at the wheel
fell dead. The engines were stopped at once, but
the submarine kept on firing, hitting the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
several times. Amongst the passengers on board
were two women and two children, and when it
was seen that the Germans were scrutinising the
ship through glasses, the children were held up so
that they might be seen. Meanwhile the boats
were lowered, the mate and 14 hands getting
into the port boat, while the master, eight hands
and the five passengers entered the starboard boat.
The position was 42 miles from land, and the boats
were picked up at 9.15 p.m. that night.</p>

<p>The fact that only one man was killed can
hardly be attributed to the humanity of the
Germans, who continued to shell the ship after
she was hove to, and even when they knew that
there were women and children on board.</p>

<p>The s.s. <i>Glenby</i> was overhauled by a submarine
and told to abandon ship at 4.15 p.m. on the 17th
August, 1915. While the crew were lowering their
boats the submarine opened fire, seriously wounding
one man and slightly wounding another. The
shots also damaged the port life-boat, besides
severing her falls. The crew in two boats were
picked up at 7.15 the same evening, when it
was found that two men were missing.</p>

<p>On the 4th September, 1915, at 12.30 a.m., the
s.s. <i>Cymbeline</i> came under fire from a submarine,
which torpedoed the steamer while her crew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
37 hands were getting into their boats. The
explosion destroyed one boat, causing the loss of
six men. The survivors were taken into the
other boat, which then contained 31 men, four of
whom were seriously wounded. They were afloat
for 16 hours before they fell in with a sailing
vessel, which towed them to within three miles
of the coast. They did not reach land, however,
until 11 o&rsquo;clock next morning. The position of
the ship when torpedoed was 80 miles from land.</p>

<p>At 8.20 a.m. on the 30th November, 1915, the
s.s. <i>Middleton</i> was shelled by a submarine while
endeavouring to escape, one man being killed
and several dangerously wounded. The crew
took to the boats. The submarine ignored the
boats, and returned no answer to an appeal for
bandages for the wounded. It was not until ten
hours afterwards that the boats were picked up,
and in the meantime two of the wounded men
had died. Another man died on board the ship
which picked them up. There were three other
wounded men, who survived.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 1st December, 1915, at
8.15 a.m., the s.s. <i>Clan Macleod</i> was shelled by a
submarine while endeavouring to escape. Soon
after the ship was first hit the master stopped her,
hoisted the international code signal indicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
that she surrendered, and blew two blasts on his
whistle. The submarine, however, again opened
fire at a range of about a quarter of a mile, first
blowing the bridge and captain&rsquo;s accommodation
to bits, and then destroying the two starboard
boats. This fire killed eight of the crew. All hands
were now ordered into the port-side boats, the
master taking charge of the life-boat, with 50
on board, while the first mate took the cutter
with a crew of 20. After sinking the ship
the submarine came alongside the boat, and some
of the Germans bound up the wounds of the
master and an apprentice. The position was
100 miles from land. The life-boat was adrift
until 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, the 2nd December,
when she was picked up by a steamer. The
mate&rsquo;s boat was adrift until 2 a.m. on Saturday,
the 4th December, when she was picked up by a
French destroyer. In the meantime one of the
wounded in this boat had died.</p>

<p>On the 2nd December, 1915, at 6.40 a.m., the
s.s. <i>Commodore</i> was shelled by a submarine while
endeavouring to escape. At 7 a.m. the vessel was
stopped, one man having been killed and another
severely wounded. While the crew were taking
to the boats five more men were wounded by shell
fire, two of them severely. The submarine then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
came alongside the boats and questioned the
master. The Germans refused to supply any
lint for the wounded men, and told the boats to
clear off. The survivors were adrift for 28 hours
before being picked up.</p>

<p>On the 9th December, 1915, at 4.20 p.m., the
s.s. <i>Orteric</i> sighted a submarine and tried to
escape. During the chase the fire of the submarine
destroyed the starboard life-boat, killed
two men, and badly wounded four others. The ship
was then hit in the stern and would not steer, so
the master signalled that he was stopping. The
submarine, however, ignored his signal and
continued firing. The crew got into three boats,
in charge of the first and second officers and chief
engineer, respectively. The master and two
hands remained on board, having the gig ready.
The three boats were about half a mile astern of
the <i>Orteric</i> when the submarine fired four shots
at the chief engineer&rsquo;s boat. All four shots missed
the boat, but only by a narrow margin. The
survivors were picked up an hour and a half
later.</p>

<p>At 1.35 p.m. on Christmas Day, 1915, the s.s.
<i>Van Stirum</i> was fired on by two submarines and
overhauled about an hour afterwards. At 2.32
p.m. the vessel was stopped, most of the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
embarking in two life-boats. The master, chief
officer, chief engineer, and Marconi operator then
got into a boat on the port side, leaving the
boatswain and a seaman to lower away and follow
them into the boat. One of the submarines was
on the port quarter 200 yards away, and as these
two men were coming down the falls, a torpedo
was fired, which passed under the boat and struck
the ship&rsquo;s side. The explosion killed both men
in the falls. The position was 20 miles from land,
and the survivors were picked up an hour later
by a trawler.</p>

<p>The sinking of these seven vessels was accompanied
by unnecessary loss of life. In the case
of the <i>Glenby</i> there was no reason for the Germans
to open fire before the crew had abandoned ship.
Three men were wounded and two lost, simply
because the Germans would not allow them time
to enter their boats. No excuse can be advanced
for the Germans. Again, with regard to the
<i>Cymbeline</i>, lives were lost because she was torpedoed
while her crew were taking to their boats.
To destroy a life-boat and kill six men was an act
of wanton murder. The destruction of the
<i>Middleton</i> provides a clearer example of German
methods. When asked for bandages, the submarine
held to her course and ignored the appeal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Three of the wounded men died, probably as a
result of the Germans&rsquo; refusal to aid them.</p>

<p>Eight of the <i>Clan Macleod&rsquo;s</i> crew were killed
by German gun-fire after the ship had been hove
to. This loss of life was, of course, unnecessary,
and was deliberately caused by the Germans
after the signal of surrender had been run up. It
is true that the submarine crew bound up the
wounds of the master and an apprentice; but
why were the wounds ever inflicted? Very
similar was the fate of the <i>Commodore</i>, which
involved another cowardly attack upon men who
were taking to their boats. On this occasion the
Germans deliberately refused lint for the wounded,
although the submarine came alongside the boats.</p>

<p>Even worse was the conduct of the submariners
who attacked the <i>Orteric</i>. They waited until
her boats were half a mile astern of the steamer,
and then deliberately fired at the boat of the
chief engineer. It is idle for anyone to pretend
that these shots were intended for the ship; they
were aimed at an open boat, and each one of the
four shots very nearly hit her. Only bad shooting
prevented the murder of this boat-load of defenceless
seamen.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the sinking of the
<i>Van Stirum</i> on Christmas Day, attended by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
deliberate murder of two men. A torpedo was
fired under one of the ship&rsquo;s boats while two men
were coming down the falls, and the explosion
killed them both. In a few more minutes these
men would have been safe, and those on board
the submarine, which was only 200 yards away,
must have known this perfectly well. They
would not wait a couple of minutes, but preferred
to murder the men in cold blood. Here, as in
other cases, the utter uselessness of the deed must
strike any unprejudiced mind. The U-boats&rsquo;
mission is to sink this or that ship, but the U-boat
commander appears to delight in adding murder
to his daily programme.</p>

<p>The French Channel packet <i>Sussex</i> carried
over 380 passengers, including about 270 women
and children and 20 Americans, when, at 4.35 p.m.
on the 24th March, 1916, she was torpedoed
without warning. There were 50 casualties;
but, although her bows were blown to pieces, the
vessel was towed inside Boulogne breakwater and
beached.</p>

<p>The Germans tried to evade the responsibility
for this outrage by suggesting that the <i>Sussex</i>
had been sunk by a British mine. They admitted
sinking a ship at the time, and in the position
where the <i>Sussex</i> was sunk, but declared that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was a war vessel which they had torpedoed.
That the German contentions were false was
eventually proved beyond doubt, as the following
evidence will show.</p>

<p>The American Consul at Boulogne sent this
message to the Secretary of State, Washington:
&ldquo;<i>Sussex</i> torpedoed by German submarine incontestably
proved by piece of torpedo found on
board <i>Sussex</i> by Balincourt, French Commandant,
le front de Mere, Boulogne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 25th March, 1916, the Divisional Naval
Transport officer at Boulogne writes: &ldquo;I personally
inspected the <i>Sussex</i> this morning, and
was shown by the French authorities pieces of the
torpedo which had been found in the ship, thus
establishing the fact that she was torpedoed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reckless and unscrupulous methods of
the German were well illustrated in the sinking of
the <i>Sussex</i>. The U-boat commander obviously
took no pains to discover what kind of vessel he
was going to attack. He simply fired a torpedo
and disappeared. Afterwards he tried to shuffle
off the responsibility for his deed by a number of
falsehoods. While admitting that he had destroyed
a certain vessel at a certain time, he
declared that he believed her to have been a
war vessel of the <i>Arabis</i> class. Stories founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
on his statements were freely circulated by the
German Government; but they were effectively
answered by a British official reply in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. There is no resemblance whatever between
a vessel of the <i>Arabis</i> class and the <i>Sussex</i>, and
it is quite impossible to mistake one vessel for
the other.</p>

<p>2. The Germans are condemned out of
their own mouths by their statement that the
commander of the German submarine fired
on some vessel at a certain moment. Now
that certain moment was precisely the time at
which the <i>Sussex</i> was attacked.</p>

<p>3. The German submarine commander admitted
that he had destroyed the fore part of
the vessel he attacked. No other ship but the
<i>Sussex</i> suffered in this way.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was unfortunate for the Germans that the
<i>Sussex</i>, although so badly damaged, could be
towed in and beached. Had she sunk, the
German contention that her fate was due to a
mine would have been more difficult to refute.
When, however, pieces of a torpedo were discovered
on board, the method of her destruction
was proved beyond all doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 18th April, 1916, the United
States sent a Note to the German Imperial
Government. The Note pointed out that&mdash;&ldquo;The
<i>Sussex</i> was never armed; she was a ship
which, as is well known, was regularly employed
only for the transport of passengers across the
English Channel. She did not follow the route
pursued by troop transports or munition ships.
About 80 passengers, non-combatants of every
age and both sexes, including citizens of the
United States, were killed or wounded.&rdquo; The
outrageous methods of German submarine warfare
are so admirably exposed by the American
Government in this official communication that
we cannot do better than reproduce certain of
the passages here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the sinking of the <i>Sussex</i> had been an
isolated case,&rdquo; says the Note, &ldquo;that would enable
the Government of the United States to hope that
the officer responsible for the deed arbitrarily
exceeded his instructions, or in criminal negligence
failed to observe the prescribed measures of
precaution, and that satisfaction might be done
to justice by his appropriate punishment, associated
with a formal disavowal of his conduct and
the payment of appropriate compensation by the
Imperial Government. But although the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
on the <i>Sussex</i> was evidently indefensible and
caused so tragic a loss of human life that it appears
as one of the most terrible examples of the inhumanity
of the submarine warfare as waged by
the commanders of German vessels, it unhappily
stands not alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After recalling former protests by the American
Government and Germany&rsquo;s unlawful attempt
to close a part of the high seas, the Note continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The international law, which here applies
and upon which the United States Government
based its protest, is not of recent origin or based
on purely arbitrary principles established by
agreement. On the contrary, it rests on obvious
principles of humanity, and has long been in force,
with the approval and the express assent of all
civilised nations. The Imperial Government insisted,
notwithstanding, on prosecuting the policy
announced, while it expressed the hope that the
existing dangers, at least for neutral ships, would
be restricted to a minimum by instructions given
to the commanders of its submarines, and assured
the United States Government that it would
apply every possible precaution to respect the
rights of neutrals and protect the lives of non-combatants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In pursuit of this policy of submarine warfare
against its enemy&rsquo;s trade, so announced and begun
despite the solemn protest of the United States
Government, the Imperial Government&rsquo;s submarine
commanders have practised a procedure
of such reckless destruction as made it more and
more clear during recent months that the Imperial
Government has found no way to impose upon
them such restrictions as it had hoped and promised.
The Imperial Government has repeatedly
and solemnly assured the United States Government
that passenger ships, at least, would not be
thus treated, and yet it has repeatedly allowed
its submarine commanders to disregard these
assurances with impunity. Even in February
of this year it announced that it regarded armed
merchantmen in enemy possession as part of the
armed naval forces of its adversaries, and would
treat them as warships, while it bound itself, at
least implicitly, to warn unarmed vessels and
guarantee the lives of their passengers and crews;
but their submarine commanders have freely
disregarded even this restriction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neutral ships, even neutral ships <i>en route</i>
from neutral port to neutral port, have been
destroyed, just as hostile ships, in steadily
increasing number. Attacked merchantmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
have sometimes been warned and challenged
to surrender before being fired on or torpedoed,
sometimes the most scanty security has been
granted to their passengers and crews of being
allowed to enter boats before the ship was sunk;
but repeatedly no warning has been given, and
not even refuge in boats was granted to passengers
on board. Great ships like the <i>Lusitania</i> and the
<i>Arabic</i>, and purely passenger ships like the <i>Sussex</i>,
have been attacked without any warning, often
before they were aware they were in the presence
of an armed enemy ship, and the life of non-combatants,
passengers, and crews was indiscriminately
destroyed in a manner which the Government
of the United States could only regard as
wanton and lacking every justification. Indeed,
no sort of limit was set to the further indiscriminate
destruction of merchantmen of every kind and
nationality outside the waters which the Imperial
Government has been pleased to indicate as
within the war zone. The list of Americans who
lost their lives on the vessels thus attacked and
destroyed has increased month by month, until
the terrible number of the victims has risen to
hundreds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The German reply to America was dated 4th
May, 1916, and one or two extracts will indicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
its tone. After vigorously denying any &ldquo;deliberate
method of indiscriminate destruction of vessels of
all sorts,&rdquo; the German Government states &ldquo;that
it has as far as possible instituted a far-reaching
restraint upon the use of the submarine weapon
solely in consideration of neutrals&rsquo; interests, in
spite of the fact that these restrictions were
necessarily of advantage to Germany&rsquo;s enemies.
No such consideration has ever been shown to
neutrals by Great Britain and her Allies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last sentence is very typical of the hardy
impertinence of Berlin. Later on in the Note,
the German Government &ldquo;notifies the Government
of the United States that the German Naval
Forces receive the following orders for submarine
warfare in accordance with the general principles
of visit, search, and destruction of merchant
vessels recognised by international law. Such
vessels, both within and without the area declared
as a naval war zone, shall not be sunk
without warning, and without saving human
lives, unless the ship attempts to escape or offer
resistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 2nd April, 1916, the British s.s. <i>Simla</i>,
while making 11 knots, was torpedoed without
warning in the Mediterranean. The explosion
made a hole in her port side 30 feet by 8 feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
size, and the engines stopped of themselves. This
took place at 1 p.m. Boats were lowered, and
150 of the crew embarked, the remaining 10, who
were Asiatic firemen, having been killed by the
explosion. After the ship had been abandoned
a submarine appeared and fired seven shells into
her, sinking her at 2.30 p.m. The survivors
were picked up by a French patrol-boat at 5 p.m.
on the same day.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Zent</i> was in ballast off the Fastnet
when at 10.20 p.m. on the 6th April, 1916, she was
attacked by a submarine. She was struck by a
torpedo in the engine-room and immediately
afterwards by another in No. 3 hatch on the
starboard side. She had been proceeding at
13½ knots, and sank in two minutes. Three boats
were lowered but, owing to the way on the ship,
they capsized, and those who could clung to the
bottom of an upturned boat. Forty-nine men
were drowned; eleven men and two corpses were
picked up 2½ hours later, two of the rescued being
slightly injured and taken to hospital.</p>

<p>The loss of life was due to the vessel being
torpedoed without any warning. If the Germans
had allowed even a short period of grace, it is
probable that there would have been no casualties.
To sink a ship while proceeding at full speed is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
equivalent to murder, and, as in other similar
cases, this was unnecessary murder.</p>

<p>The British steamer <i>Whitgift</i> was torpedoed
and sunk on the 20th April, 1916, but there are
no details about the occurrence, as the whole of
her crew, except one Japanese, were drowned.
This survivor was taken prisoner by the Germans.
The only particulars about the sinking of the
ship are contained in a letter which he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I am now in Lager Holzminden Barrack 4. On
the 20 April our schip has been torpedoed by a German
U-boot and only I have been saved by the German
U-boot and now I am prisoner.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Great Eastern Railway Company&rsquo;s steamer
<i>Brussels</i>, while on voyage from the Hook of
Holland to Tilbury, was captured by the Germans
in the early morning of the 23rd of June and
taken into Zeebrugge. The master of the vessel
was Captain Charles Fryatt. On the 29th of July
the text of a German official announcement
appeared in the <i>Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;On Thursday, at Bruges, before the Court-Martial
of the Marine Corps, the trial took place of Captain
Charles Fryatt, of the British steamer <i>Brussels</i>,
which was brought in as a prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The accused was condemned to death because,
although he was not a member of a combatant force,
he made an attempt on the afternoon of 28th March,
1915, to ram the German submarine U33 near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Maas Lightship. The accused, as well as the first
officer and the chief engineer of the steamer, received
at the time from the British Admiralty a gold watch,
as a reward for his brave conduct on that occasion,
and his action was mentioned with praise in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the occasion in question, disregarding the
U-boat&rsquo;s signal to stop and show his national flag
he turned at a critical moment at high speed on the
submarine, which escaped the steamer by a few
metres only, by immediately diving. He confessed
that in so doing he had acted in accordance with the
instructions of the Admiralty. The sentence was
confirmed yesterday (Thursday) afternoon and carried
out by shooting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the many nefarious <i>franc-tireur</i> proceedings
of the British merchant marine against our war
vessels has thus found a belated, but merited, expiation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in face of the German official announcement
quoted, the British Government were
unwilling to believe that the murder of Captain
Fryatt had indeed taken place. The Foreign
Office communicated with the American Ambassador
at Berlin, asking that the facts of the case
might be ascertained. This communication
stated that &ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Government find it
difficult to believe that a master of a merchant
vessel who, after German submarines adopted
the practice of sinking merchant vessels without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
warning and without regard for the lives of
passengers or crew, took a step which appeared
to afford the only chance of saving not only his
vessel, but the lives of all on board, can have
been deliberately shot in cold blood for this action.
If the German Government have in fact perpetrated
such a crime in the case of a British
subject held prisoner by them, it is evident that a
most serious condition of affairs has arisen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The murder was referred to in the House of
Commons and reported in the <i>Times</i> of the
1st August, 1916. In reply to a question by
Sir Edward Carson, Mr. Asquith made the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;I deeply regret to say that it appears to be true
that Captain Fryatt has been murdered by the
Germans. His Majesty&rsquo;s Government have heard
with the utmost indignation of this atrocious crime
against the law of nations and the usages of war.
Coming as it does contemporaneously with the
lawless cruelties to the population of Lille and other
occupied districts of France, it shows that the German
High Command have, under the stress of military
defeat, renewed their policy of terrorism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to guess to what further atrocities
they may proceed. His Majesty&rsquo;s Government,
therefore, desire to repeat emphatically that they
are resolved that such crimes shall not, if they can
help it, go unpunished. When the time arrives
they are determined to bring to justice the criminals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
whoever they may be, and whatever their station.
In such cases as this the man who authorises the
system under which such crimes are committed
may well be the most guilty of all.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances connected with Captain
Fryatt&rsquo;s death are not disputed by either side;
everyone can, therefore, form his own opinion
about the case. It is as well to remember, however,
that Germany declared a blockade of the
British Isles in February, 1915, a month before
Captain Fryatt encountered the U33, and that
the U-boat pirates were employing methods of
&ldquo;frightfulness&rdquo; in March, 1915.</p>

<p>The captain was perfectly justified in believing
that the U33 would sink his ship without giving
those aboard her time to enter their boats. He
acted as any man of spirit would have acted in
similar circumstances, and the German defence
of his murder breaks down when we recall the
conduct of the U-boat commanders at that time.
On the very day when Captain Fryatt met the
U33 another German submarine was sinking the
s.s. <i>Falaba</i>, without giving the passengers or crew
time to abandon ship. The <i>Falaba</i>, it will be
remembered, sank in eight minutes, with a loss of
104 lives. Was not Captain Fryatt justified in
saving his crew from the chances of a similar
fate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 21st September the s.s. <i>Curamalan</i>
proceeded to sea. She had been in the service of
the Argentine Republic for twenty years, and
could not, therefore, be classed as a ship transferred
for use during the war. Her owners were
subjects of the Republic, and she was chartered
by the Argentine Whaling Company to carry
coal from Newport (Wales) to South Georgia.
Such vessels are in the habit of speaking St.
Vincent, Cape Verde, <i>en route</i>, but the <i>Curamalan</i>
did not do so. She has been missing &ldquo;without
trace&rdquo; since the date of her sailing, and it has
been presumed by the authorities that she was
sunk in European waters.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that while Argentina was
in controversy with the German Government
about the destruction of her ships by submarines,
Count Luxburg, the German <i>Chargé d&rsquo;Affaires</i>
in Buenos Ayres, was sending home, by way of
the Swedish Foreign Office, recommendations that
certain vessels should be sunk &ldquo;without a trace.&rdquo;
That was in July, 1917, but the total loss of the
<i>Curamalan</i> and her crew of 29 suggests the suspicion
that this policy of sinking &ldquo;without a
trace&rdquo; dates a good deal further back.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>North Wales</i> left Hull
bound for Canada on the 20th October 1916, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
on the 10th November the Canadian naval
authorities reported her as overdue. On the
9th November the German Wireless Press gave
the name of this vessel in their list of torpedoed
ships, so that, although details are lacking, her
fate is fairly certain. She was sunk almost
without trace. One piece of varnished wood
marked &ldquo;<i>North Wales</i>&rdquo; was washed ashore in
Sennen Cove, and one or two bodies reached the
Cornish coast. That is all. If her crew had time
to take to their boats, after being torpedoed, they
were probably drowned, as violent gales were
raging at the time.</p>

<p>The British s.s. <i>Cabotia</i> carried a crew of 74.
She was on voyage from Montreal to Liverpool,
and had encountered bad weather most of the
way. On the morning of the 20th October there
was a strong gale blowing from the S.W. and
a heavy sea running. At about 12.20 p.m. a
German submarine was sighted on the starboard
bow and at once opened fire with her forward gun.
Her first shot struck the steamer about amidships
on the starboard side, but the master turned
her stern to the submarine and put on full speed.
The U-boat continued firing at the rate of a shot
every five minutes, and out of seven shots she
obtained four hits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The steamer&rsquo;s boats were now swung out, though
all hands realised that probably they would not
live long in such a sea. The submarine kept
trying to get on the <i>Cabotia&rsquo;s</i> quarter, but she
was kept well astern. However, she continued
to gain on the steamship, and by 2 p.m. was
close astern. The engines were stopped, four
boats were lowered, manned and got clear of the
steamer without mishap. Of these boats, Nos. 1
and 2 were in charge of the master and third
officer, respectively, while the second officer took
No. 3 boat and the chief officer No. 4.</p>

<p>The submarine, after again shelling the <i>Cabotia</i>,
went alongside another steamer which now approached.
The boats proceeded in the same
direction, hoping to be picked up; but the
steamer, after communicating with the U-boat,
blew two blasts on her whistle, apparently saluting
the submarine, and steamed away. The third
and fourth boats, carrying 42 men altogether,
were picked up by a patrol boat; but the other
two boats were never seen again, 32 lives being
lost.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the submarine
commander could have saved every one of these
lives, had he told the steamer whom he closed
to pick up the <i>Cabotia&rsquo;s</i> boats. Apart from this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
it is the opinion of the survivors that those on
board the strange steamer saw their signals of
distress, shirts hoisted on oars, but deliberately
ignored them.</p>

<p>About the fate of the British s.s. <i>Rappahannock</i>
there was some doubt at the time of her disappearance,
but it has since been established that she
was sunk on the 26th October, 1916. In November
the Admiralty received a message from the
owners of the vessel to the effect that information
had been received by them from Captain Cuvellier,
of the Belgian Marine Department, that an inquest
had been held at Porranporth on a body washed
ashore on the 8th November. This was the
body of a donkeyman named Theakins, one of
the crew of the <i>Rappahannock</i>. Then came
news from the s.s. <i>Corinthian</i>, who reported that
on the 9th November she found a quantity of
deals, wood pulp, and barrels of apples afloat 60
miles west from the Scilly Islands. These articles
formed part of the <i>Rappahannock&rsquo;s</i> cargo.</p>

<p>On the 27th January, 1917, Berlin published
the following announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English steamer <i>Rappahannock</i> was
forced to stop by a German submarine on 26th
October, 1916, following a pursuit of some length,
and sunk after the crew had been given ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
time to leave the vessel. The distance from the
point of sinking to the Scillies was about 70
nautical miles, wind and sea were W.S.W. of the
third strength. The safety of the crew, who had
entered the boats, appeared to the commander
of the submarine to be guaranteed, inasmuch as
the life-boats were in good condition and well
equipped with sails and provisions, and were able
to reach land quickly and safely in view of the
favourable sailing wind, which pointed towards
land, and the slight sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the weather conditions had, indeed, been all
that the German commander here claims, it is
fairly certain that most of the crew would have
reached land. As a matter of fact, not a single
member of the steamer&rsquo;s crew was ever seen alive
again. The inevitable conclusion is that the
weather must have been unfavourable, and that
the German commander must have known what
the fate of the crew would be.</p>

<p>On the 6th November, 1916, the British passenger
steamship <i>Arabia</i> was torpedoed in the
Mediterranean without warning. She carried
437 passengers, of whom many were women and
children, and a crew of 304. The torpedo struck
her in the engine-room at 11.22 a.m., the explosion
killing 11 men. The engines stopped at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
once, and the wireless was rendered useless.
There was no confusion on board, the last boat
leaving the ship at 11.37 a.m., and the only
casualties were those caused by the explosion.</p>

<p>The following message, addressed to Wolff&rsquo;s
Telegraph Bureau, Berlin, from a German in
New York, was afterwards intercepted by the
Admiralty:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;In Washington deep impression was made by
German Admiralty&rsquo;s announcement that German
submarine sunk <i>Arabia</i>. There was even surprise
expressed that attack on <i>Arabia</i> was semi-officially
admitted. Admiralty&rsquo;s explanation is
considered as incomprehensible because <i>Arabia</i>,
according to information received here, was
ordinary passenger liner with many passengers
on board, not carrying troops nor being under
British Government charter.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Only the splendid efficiency of officers and crew
and the coolness of the passengers on board the
<i>Arabia</i> prevented a terrible tragedy. To abandon
ship successfully in fifteen minutes was a fine
feat which averted a big disaster. The Germans
who torpedoed this passenger ship without warning
cannot, however, be allowed any credit for
the small loss of life. It is quite obvious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they did not care whether the women and children
perished or not.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>Moresby</i> was torpedoed
without warning on the 28th November, 1916.
The ship at once settled down by the stern, and
as she disappeared in 1½ minutes there was no
possibility of getting any of the boats out or doing
anything to save life. The submarine was not
seen. The chief officer, his wife, one A.B. and
29 Chinamen were lost. The master, second
mate, second and third engineers, one A.B. and
seven Chinamen were saved.</p>

<p>James Rose, second hand, was on the deck of the
British sailing trawler <i>Trevone</i> at half-past three
in the afternoon of 30th January, 1917, when a
German submarine suddenly appeared on the
surface and opened fire. Her second shot hit the
peak halyards, and the master and crew immediately
took to their boat. They were ordered
alongside the submarine and told to board her.
In attempting to obey, the master and cook were
both washed overboard. These two men could
easily have been rescued, but the Germans took
not the slightest notice of them. The master
was seen hanging on to the submarine&rsquo;s side, aft,
for over ten minutes, but finally disappeared.</p>

<p>The remaining three hands were searched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
relieved of their knives and money. They then
had to write their names and ages upon a piece of
paper, and were afterwards taken before the
commanding officer, who examined them through
a junior officer who spoke English.</p>

<p>The men noticed several chocolate-coloured
bags hanging in the submarine, marked U55.
They were given tea, and at 5 p.m. the U-boat
submerged, and appeared to be stationary until
10 p.m., although the engines were kept running.
She then came to the surface and remained there
all night. The men were given hammocks to
sleep in, but could not sleep, so talked to the
submarine&rsquo;s crew, who said they had sunk seven
sailing vessels that day. At 9 a.m. next morning
they had breakfast; at 10.45 they were
ordered on deck, and received their knives back.
The German officers kept eight shillings of their
money. Finally they were sent off in the boat of
a French schooner, and were fortunate enough to
be picked up five hours later.</p>

<p>The worst feature of this case is the callous
disregard shown by the Germans when the master
and cook fell into the sea. These two men were
allowed to drown right under the eyes of the
Germans. After all, the poor fellows were only
trying to carry out the U-boat commander&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
order when they fell overboard, and the dictates
of common decency would have caused any
ordinary civilised man to have made at least
some sort of effort to rescue them. No great
effort would have been necessary; their own
comrades could have picked up both men, if the
Germans had allowed this.</p>

<p>Instead, the commander preferred to leave
the master clinging to the side of the submarine
until the icy winter water and his failing
strength obliged the wretched man to relax his
hold and sink to his death. It is a disgusting
incident, which fills the mind with indignation
against the man who could permit such a thing
to happen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot put these Germans
down as exceptional types. From what happened
afterwards, they appear to have been just ordinary
members of the U-boat service. They did not,
for example, ill-treat their prisoners while on
board the submarine; and beyond the theft of a
few shillings by the German officers, the trawler&rsquo;s
crew had no ground for complaint. But the
whole incident shows the low standard of morality
prevailing among German submariners. Two
men allowed to drown; eight shillings stolen from
the survivors. That is all, and apparently such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
trifling incidents are taken as a matter of course
in the German submarine service. What can be
said for such men? How can normal people
understand their motives?</p>

<p>The British steamer <i>Eavestone</i> left Barry Docks
on the 1st February, 1917, for Gibraltar. On
the 3rd February, she was 100 miles W. by S.W. of
the Fastnets when she sighted a submarine. The
German opened fire at 3,000 yards and soon found
the range. Firing at the rate of a shot a minute,
she struck the steamer repeatedly, and continued
firing while the crew took to their boats. As
soon as the boats had dropped astern of their ship,
the submarine turned her gun upon them at short
range, firing three shrapnel shells and striking
both boats. The third shell killed the master,
the steward, and a donkeyman, wounded two
able seamen, and severely wounded the second
officer in the right arm.</p>

<p>The submarine now called the first mate on
board and questioned him, but no enquiries were
made as to the <i>Eavestone&rsquo;s</i> losses, and no help was
suggested. The boats were picked up that same
night by the Norwegian barque <i>Regna</i>.</p>

<p>Here is a typical case of the pirate as murderer.
Having done his best to kill the steamer&rsquo;s crew,
while they were taking to their boats, he deliber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ately
turns his gun against the open boats as soon
as they are manned and clear of the vessel. Without
any shadow of pretext, the pirate kills three
men and wounds three others in this way. The
number of men killed was of no interest to the
German. He did not even enquire as to the
result of his shrapnel fire, and of course it never
occurred to him to offer the survivors any help.</p>

<p>On the 7th February, 1917, at 11.30 a.m., in
squally weather the <i>Vulcana</i> sighted a German
submarine on her starboard boom, about 1 mile
distant. The U-boat at once opened fire. She
found the range after firing half-a-dozen shots.</p>

<p>The skipper gave orders for the boat to be
lowered, and while the tackle was being carried
forward, he stood close by the engine-room door
on the starboard side of the deck. The second
hand was standing about 2 feet away from him
at the time. Just afterwards a shell exploded
close by. One piece struck the second hand&rsquo;s
boot and another cut his hand slightly. The
skipper was struck on the top of the head; his
head was smashed in and part of his face was
blown away. The second hand heard him say:
&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; and he fell to the deck, dead.</p>

<p>George King, the second hand, now took charge.
Shells continued to burst about the deck; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
passed through the galley and struck the trimmer,
wounding him severely in the back. After the
boat had been got out she capsized, and had to be
righted before the crew could get in. The skipper
being dead, they left him where he had fallen,
and he went down with his ship. George King
followed the crew into their boat, and soon after
she had got clear the ship went down, about noon.
The submarine then submerged and disappeared.
The survivors were picked up by a patrol-boat
at noon on the following day. The trimmer
was taken to hospital, where he afterwards
died.</p>

<p>The <i>Vulcana</i> was a British trawler, although,
from the savageness of the German attack, it
might have been thought that she was a warship.
The lives of the skipper and trimmer were sacrificed
to German blood lust. The trawler could
have been sunk without any loss of life.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th February, 1917,
the British steamers <i>St. Ninian</i> and <i>Corsican
Prince</i> were within a quarter of a mile of one
another. A U-boat torpedoed the <i>Corsican
Prince</i>, striking No. 3 hold and bursting her
engine-room bulkhead. The <i>St. Ninian</i> was then
sunk. She went down in five minutes. Both ships
were torpedoed without warning, the casualties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
being 15 in the case of the <i>St. Ninian</i> and one in
the <i>Corsican Prince</i>.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>California</i> carried 32
passengers and a crew of 171 hands; she was
bound from New York to Glasgow. On the morning
of the 7th February, 1917, the weather was
fine and clear, the wind was N.E., and there was
a heavy swell running. At 9.30 a.m., the master
and two junior officers being on the bridge, a
periscope was sighted about 250 yards away on
the port quarter. The master at once ordered
the helm hard aport and an S.O.S. signal to be
sent out, but before the vessel had paid off 3 points
a torpedo struck her on the port quarter, about
No. 4 hatch, and the submarine was not seen
again.</p>

<p>The engine-room was flooded. Boats were
lowered on both sides to the level of the bridge
deck to embark the passengers; but the ship was
settling down quickly by the stern, and before
the boats could be lowered they were afloat. A
number of passengers were in the boats when they
took the water, and one on the starboard side was
overturned, the passengers being thrown into the
water. Another boat, which had to be cut loose,
threw three people into the water. Ten boats got
clear of the ship, which sank at 9.30 a.m., the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
master remaining on the bridge. He was picked up
half-an-hour later by one of the boats. A patrol-boat
had taken in the S.O.S. signal and arrived
on the scene in time to rescue 160 survivors.</p>

<p>Forty-three lives were lost by drowning and
injuries, and there were thirty cot cases among
the survivors. A few facts reveal the tragic side
of the occurrence. Seven women and four
children were killed; three young children were
saved, their mother being lost; one small boy
was saved, while the bodies of his mother, brother,
and sister were afterwards washed ashore.</p>

<p>The facts speak for themselves and make
comment almost superfluous. The passengers
and crew never got a fair chance of saving themselves,
as the vessel was torpedoed without any
kind of warning.</p>

<p>At 7 a.m. on the 10th February, 1917, a shot
was fired at the British steamship <i>Sallagh</i> by a
submarine on her starboard quarter. The submarine
then hoisted the signal &ldquo;abandon ship,&rdquo;
and while the boat was being got ready, fired
again, killing the chief engineer and seriously
wounding two other men. The Germans afterwards
placed bombs in the vessel, and fired two
shots into her. The second caused an explosion
and the ship sank. Having provided bandages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
for the wounded men, the Germans rigged their
craft like a smack and lay off about 5 miles in wait
for another victim. The ship&rsquo;s boat was picked
up at 4.30 p.m. on the same day.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>Afric</i> was 12 miles S.S.W.
of the Eddystone Lighthouse at about 5.15 a.m. on
the 12th February, 1917. Suddenly a torpedo
struck her on the starboard side about abreast of
the engine-room, causing a terrific explosion,
which stopped the engines, put out all lights,
broke the telegraphs, and brought the aerial down.
The engineers and greasers on watch at the time
were killed. The rest of the crew left the ship and
stood by in eight boats, leaving the master, first
officer and steward on board. At 6 a.m. a second
explosion occurred on the port side abreast of
No. 1 hold. The ship was finally abandoned
after this, and at about 6.20 a.m. a submarine
appeared, questioned the master, and then shelled
the ship, which sank at 7.45 a.m. The boats
were picked up about 5 hours later. Five men
were killed, probably by the first explosion.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Sallagh</i> appears to have been
shelled as a matter of course while her boats were
being got out. Otherwise there would have been
no loss of life and no wounded on board. As the
submarine took the trouble to hoist the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
&ldquo;abandon ship,&rdquo; which was at once obeyed, she
had no excuse for the subsequent shelling. The
case is one of wholly unnecessary murder, although
the Germans were not so callous as on some
occasions.</p>

<p>At 11.15 p.m. on the 17th February, the British
steamer <i>Valdes</i> was torpedoed without warning.
It was a pitch-dark night, and nothing was seen
before the explosion of the torpedo. The master
and seven of the crew were thrown into the water
as the ship went down; three men went down with
her. The port life-boat was successfully launched,
and 20 members of the crew embarked. The
starboard life-boat was blown to pieces. A trawler
picked up the 20 survivors, but two of them died
from exposure. Eleven men lost their lives.</p>

<p>The British steamship <i>Laconia</i> was sunk on the
25th February. She carried a crew of 217 and
77 passengers. When about 140 miles from
the S.W. of Ireland, at 10.53 at night, she was
torpedoed without warning and began to list to
starboard. The boats were quickly lowered;
all the passengers and most of the crew embarked
before a second torpedo struck the ship. Those
left on board then abandoned her, and the submarine
soon afterwards came to the surface,
wished the boats&rsquo; companies &ldquo;good night,&rdquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
disappeared. The <i>Laconia</i> went down at about
11.48 p.m.</p>

<p>Although her boats had been lowered, the task
had not been accomplished without mishap.
Life-boat No. 8 had bumped several times against
the steamer&rsquo;s side, owing to the jambing of ropes
and the ship&rsquo;s big list. The boat took the water
bow first, and when her stern was released, she
plunged, shipping a lot of water. She was considerably
damaged before getting clear, with the
result that she was awash, except for the raised
portion of her bow and stern, when she did
eventually get clear. Every wave washed over the
boat&rsquo;s company, whose sufferings were deplorable.</p>

<p>About two hours after leaving the ship, a
first-class passenger named Mr. Robinson, who
was in delicate health, died from exposure, and
his body was washed overboard. A lady was
the next to die, but her daughter, not realising
what had happened, continued to support her
mother&rsquo;s body. An hour later the daughter
herself passed away. A coloured sailor was the
next to succumb. Then a fireman, who was
sitting on one of the thwarts, allowed his head to
sink into the water and so was drowned. A
gentleman passenger was now seen to be dead,
and a lady, who was his friend, became hysterical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
To soothe her, it was pretended that the man
had only fainted, and his body was kept in the
boat. Fifteen minutes afterwards a fireman
lurched overboard and was drowned. At 9
o&rsquo;clock next morning the boat was picked up.
All the other boats had been picked up before
daylight. Twelve lives were lost.</p>

<p>The British sailing vessel <i>Galgorm Castle</i> carried
a crew of 24. At 5.30 p.m. on the 27th February,
1917, the ship was sunk by the Germans with
bombs. The crew left in two boats, but became
separated in the darkness. One boat capsized,
drowning four men; the remaining eight clung
to her, but seven of them died from exposure.
The twelfth man, a Russian, was picked up on the
7th March. The second boat, with her 12
survivors, was picked up.</p>

<p>At 6.50 a.m. on the 1st March, 1917, while the
British trawler <i>Redcap</i> was hauling in her trawl,
a U-boat appeared and fired several shells at her.
One deck-hand was killed, the mate had his leg
blown off, and two other hands were injured. The
survivors got away in their boat, and were picked
up at 12.30 p.m. The trawler was sunk by the
Germans.</p>

<p>At 2.30 a.m. on the 17th March, the British
steamer <i>Tasso</i> was torpedoed by a U-boat at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
sight, without any kind of warning. The vessel
went down head-first, and the inrush of water
against the forecastle and cabin doors prevented
these from being opened. In this way many of
the crew perished. The master and eighteen of
the crew were drowned, six men being saved; two
of these were slightly injured in the head. They
were picked up by a French patrol steamer.</p>

<p>The British steamer <i>Joshua Nicholson</i> was
torpedoed by a German submarine without
warning at 6.30 a.m. on the 18th March, 1917.
She began to settle down very rapidly, with a
heavy list to starboard. While the port life-boat
was being lowered she capsized, and three men
were drowned. Another man was blown into the
water by an explosion. After the ship had gone
down, six men came to the surface and clung to
pieces of wreckage. Of these, three sank during
the next five hours, the remaining three being
picked up at about 5 p.m., exhausted but
alive.</p>

<p>The <i>Joshua Nicholson</i> and <i>Galgorm Castle</i> are
two ordinary instances of German sinkings. The
survivors in both cases underwent considerable
sufferings, which were in no way mitigated by the
Germans. No tow was offered and no assistance
of any kind rendered to the crews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The British steamship <i>Alnwick Castle</i> was in
the Atlantic, 320 miles from land, on the 19th
March. She carried a crew of 100, together with
14 passengers; she also had on board the master
and 24 survivors of the s.s. <i>Trevose</i>, whom she
had rescued on the previous day from their boats.
She had, therefore, 138 souls on board, when at
6 a.m. she was torpedoed without warning by a
submerged German submarine. The boats were
lowered as quickly as possible, and in about
10 minutes the steamer plunged under water,
bow first. Her whistle gave one blast; the
main topmast broke off; there was a smothered
roar, a cloud of dust, and she had disappeared.</p>

<p>The submarine had come to the surface and
trained her gun on the steamer, but no shots were
necessary to complete the sinking, and she steamed
away without even speaking the boats. One
of these was in charge of the chief officer, and
contained 31 people, including two women and a
four-months old baby. There was a considerable
swell running, with a moderate wind, so all sail
was hoisted, and the boats proceeded to the
N.E. in single file, keeping in touch with one
another for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>During the night both wind and sea increased
considerably, and the chief officer&rsquo;s boat had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
lost touch with the others by the following morning,
which was Tuesday. At 10 a.m. the weather
compelled them to take in all sail, and they lay-to,
keeping her head-on to the enormous seas with
the help of a sea-anchor and the occasional use of
the oars. They proceeded in this way throughout
the day and during Tuesday night, which was
very dark. They were thankful to see day break
on Wednesday. They had lost their sea-anchor
in the night, so lashed a couple of oars together,
which served as a fairly good substitute. The
weather improved during the morning, so they
hoisted sail again and proceeded east.</p>

<p>During Tuesday night the <i>chef</i> had gone mad,
and on Wednesday he died. Being accustomed
to the warmth of a galley fire, he could not stand
the cold. Meanwhile, the chief officer had taken
control of the provisions and water. He served
out the water in the morning and evening at the
rate of half a dipper-full to each person. During
Wednesday night the storekeeper went mad and
had to be lashed down. He died about noon on
Thursday, and a third-class passenger also expired
on the same day.</p>

<p>That night there were heavy squalls, so they
had to take in sail and put out their improvised
sea-anchor. On Friday morning the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
moderated, and they were able to set full sail
again. An A.B. died during the day, and everyone
had now begun to endure agonies of thirst. They
continued to sail all Friday night, but exposure
and exhaustion were reducing them to a state of
callousness, and at times they suffered from
light-headedness. These attacks were worse
in the night than by daylight. On Saturday
morning a fireman was found dead in the bottom
of the boat, and during the day a third-class
pantry-boy died.</p>

<p>There was little doubt in the chief officer&rsquo;s
mind that the secret drinking of salt water was
hastening the death of many. He did his best
to prevent it, but he was working watch and watch
at the tiller, and there are limits to what one man
can accomplish. They drifted with sail down all
through the night of Saturday, there being no stars
to steer by; but sail was re-hoisted at daybreak
on Sunday. A cattleman, who had been behaving
in a peculiar way for two days, made three attempts
to jump overboard, and at last succeeded.
The enfeebled state of his shipmates rendered
his rescue impossible, although they turned the
boat round and sailed about in the position
where he had disappeared.</p>

<p>To-day their last tot of water was served out&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>a
mouthful apiece&mdash;and they tried to collect
rain water from the occasional showers that
swept past them. Everything was saturated with
salt, however, so that the little they caught was
undrinkable. Then they took to licking the oars,
the tiller, the seats and the woodwork of the boat,
in their frantic efforts to gather up the rain-drops;
but the salt spray came flying in-board continually
and frustrated their hopes. At last a happy
thought occurred to them; they broke up the
empty water-breaker and licked the inside, which
they found to be saturated with moisture and
delicious to their parched tongues. That night
the deck-boy, who had been quietly sinking all
day, passed away.</p>

<p>They sighted land at 3 p.m. on Monday, and
made what haste they could to approach it.
This they accomplished late in the evening, but
darkness had set in and there was a heavy northerly
swell, which rendered any attempt at landing
too dangerous. They lay-to, therefore, awaiting
daylight. Their mast was carried away at the heel
during a squall, but it acted as a sea-anchor,
and in the morning they pulled in towards the
shore until their strength gave out. Then two
fishing-boats were observed coming out from the
harbour, and they towed the survivors into Carino.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The villagers, headed by the priest, came to
the assistance of the boat&rsquo;s company, most of
whom were unable to walk. The linen-keeper
died as he was being lifted ashore; two of the
crew, who had gone mad, refused to leave the boat,
and had to be dragged out. The villagers were
very kind, and carried the survivors to their
cottages, while their wives paid special attention
to the two women and the baby. This morsel
of humanity seemed well enough at Carino, but
died six days after being admitted to hospital at
Ferrol. A trimmer died of gangrene in the same
hospital two weeks later. The chief officer bears
testimony to the splendid behaviour of the boat&rsquo;s
crew during the eight days of hardship and exposure
which they endured. Forty lives were
lost through the sinking of the <i>Alnwick Castle</i>.</p>

<p>When about 150 miles S.E. of Cape Clear, at
3 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of 29th April, the British
steamer <i>Daleby</i> was torpedoed without warning.
She was struck twice, the second torpedo blowing
up all the life-boats and causing her to sink immediately.
The last man to leave the ship dived off
as she was sinking. The submarine then came to
the surface and circled round him, but no attempt
was made to pick him up. Afterwards he noticed
the ship&rsquo;s dinghy floating a little way off, and swam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
towards it. The wind, however, was behind him,
and kept blowing the boat away, so that he did
not reach her for two hours.</p>

<p>Having baled her out, he returned to the scene
of the disaster, where he managed to pick up a
fireman, who had been wounded in the head and
was unconscious. He revived this man, and
together they started rowing for land, although
the fireman was not able to do much work. They
were at sea in the dinghy for 24 hours, when they
were picked up by a steamer, having rowed 30
miles. Through the sinking of the <i>Daleby</i>
26 men perished.</p>

<p>When about 8 miles south of Beachy Head on
the 20th May, the British steamer <i>Tycho</i> was
torpedoed without warning and began to go down
by the head. The order to abandon ship was
given at 5.10 p.m., ten minutes after the ship
had been struck, and was carried out without
casualties. The vessel went down at 5.20.
The crew then pulled towards the steamship
<i>Porthkerry</i>, which had seen the explosion and was
standing by about 200 yards away on the port
beam.</p>

<p>As the <i>Tycho&rsquo;s</i> boats came alongside her,
another torpedo was discharged by the submarine.
This blew up one of the boats, killing the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and 14 men, and capsized the other boat. The
<i>Porthkerry</i> was abandoned, with eight casualties,
the vessel going down in three minutes after being
struck by the torpedo. The survivors from both
ships were picked up at 7 o&rsquo;clock that night by a
small coasting steamer and landed at Newhaven
at midnight on the 21st May.</p>

<p>The British steamer <i>Clan Murray</i> was about
30 miles south of the Fastnets on the 29th May
when she was torpedoed without warning, being
struck amidships on the starboard side. The
boiler and engine-rooms were immediately filled
with water, the vessel listed heavily to starboard
and foundered within five minutes. The submarine
then appeared and circled round the wreckage,
taking the third officer and one other man
prisoners. She then made off in a westerly
direction. The survivors clung to floating wreckage
for six hours before being picked up. Sixty-four
men lost their lives; 12 were saved; two were
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The sinking of the <i>Tycho</i> and <i>Porthkerry</i> is a
conspicuous instance of German callousness. The
U-boat commander waited until the <i>Tycho&rsquo;s</i> boats
were alongside the <i>Porthkerry</i> before discharging his
second torpedo, and thereby killed 15 men without
the slightest excuse or necessity. He could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
torpedoed the <i>Porthkerry</i> before those life-boats
were alongside her, but apparently he preferred
that her sinking should be accompanied by loss
of life. There seems to be no other explanation
of his conduct.</p>

<p>The schooner <i>Jane Williamson</i>, of Arklow, met
with a small German submarine off the coast of
Cornwall at 4 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of the 10th
September, 1917. The submarine opened fire at
150 yards range. Her first shot smashed one of
the boats, the second killed a man. There were
five men left, who got into their second boat, when
a shell struck her, killing one man outright and
mortally wounding the skipper and another man.
The Germans beckoned the boat to them, in order to
laugh at the survivors. The U-boat then submerged.</p>

<p>The skipper lived long enough to be landed
and taken to hospital, where he died. The two dead
seamen were buried at Penzance. An inquest
was held upon their bodies, and the coroner
described the Germans&rsquo; conduct as diabolical, the
jury returning a unanimous verdict of &ldquo;wilful
and diabolical murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 11th September, 1917, the schooner
<i>William</i>, of Dublin, was attacked by a U-boat,
which, after sinking her, fired on her crew with
shrapnel, wounding one man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The sinking of the <i>Jane Williamson</i> has been
included under the heading of &ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; but it
might as appropriately have been labelled &ldquo;Barbarity.&rdquo;
The Germans displayed a callous disregard
for human life, and after killing two men,
signalled the boat alongside, in order that they
might mock the dying. Plain men will agree
with the jury&rsquo;s verdict of wilful and diabolical
murder. The Germans&rsquo; behaviour was that of
savages.</p>

<p>The crew of the schooner <i>William</i> were lucky
enough to escape with one man wounded, but the
Germans&rsquo; intention was again murder.</p>

<p>The French sailing barquentine <i>Mimosa</i> had a
crew of 31. On the 24th September, 1917, when
23 miles S.W. of the Scilly Islands, with a cargo
of salt fish, she was attacked by a German submarine.
It was 6 p.m., the weather was clear, the
sea calm, and the visibility good. A submarine
appeared and at 6.15 p.m. opened fire on the
Frenchman. When 23 shots had been fired the
ship was abandoned by all except the master,
who refused to leave his vessel and was killed at
the wheel by shrapnel. The submarine, which
appeared to be an old one, dirty-grey in colour,
and showing no number, closed the <i>Mimosa</i> to
150 yards on the surface. One German officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was seen, a thin, clean-shaven man, with dark
hair and sunken cheeks. He ordered six men from
one of the boats to board the submarine, and
lined them up on deck forward of his gun. Soon
afterwards the hatches of the submarine were
closed, and she submerged, throwing the men
into the sea without any means of saving themselves.
The men were lucky enough to be able to
reach their boats, however. Two boats, carrying
15 men altogether, were picked up by a British
destroyer, and three boats, carrying the other 15
men, rowed to the Scilly Islands. The master
was buried at sea by the crew of the destroyer.</p>

<p>The German appears to have had in mind his
fellow-countryman&rsquo;s exploit with the crew of the
<i>Belgian Prince</i>. But he had not studied the case
carefully enough, and so his victims were able to
escape. To line up half-a-dozen men on the deck
of the submarine and then to submerge was
obviously an attempt to commit deliberate murder,
and for this reason the case of the <i>Mimosa</i> has
been included in this chapter.</p>

<p>The s.s. <i>Elmsgarth</i> was torpedoed without
warning at 7.15 p.m. on the 29th September,
and abandoned a quarter of an hour afterwards.
A U-boat then appeared and fired a shell between
the life-boats. The master&rsquo;s boat was then hailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
alongside the submarine in order that he might be
questioned by the commander. The master
pointed out that his boat was half full of water,
and asked for a baler, but this the commander
refused to supply, adding that his duty was not
to save life, but to destroy it.</p>

<p>Before the boat shoved off from the submarine, a
Mexican fireman, Daniel Vaca by name, jumped
on board the U-boat and claimed protection as a
neutral. The Germans&rsquo; response to this appeal
was to deprive the man of his passport and
order him back into the life-boat. Good fortune
favoured the boats, which made for the Irish
coast in safety.</p>

THE PIRATE AS BARBARIAN.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We Germans represent the latest and highest achievement
of European Kultur.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Professor A. Lasson.</span></p>

<p class="p2">On the 25th November, 1914, the British
Admiralty announced that on 26th
October, 1914, the French passenger steamer
<i>Amiral Ganteaume</i>, while on passage from
Calais to Havre with upwards of 2,000
unarmed refugees, including a very large proportion
of women and children on board, was
torpedoed. By pure chance and the greatest
good fortune, the British steamship <i>Queen</i> was
within a short distance of the <i>Amiral Ganteaume</i>,
and succeeded in rescuing most of the passengers,
only about 40 being killed. Subsequent examination
of one of the vessel&rsquo;s damaged life-boats led to
the discovery of a fragment of a German torpedo.
The Admiralty announcement concluded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This action of destroying with aim and
deliberation in broad daylight a defenceless passenger
ship, full of refugees, is on the whole the
best specimen of German methods yet recorded.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 10th April, 1915, at 9.55 a.m., the Belgian
relief-ship <i>Harpalyce</i> was torpedoed without
warning 26 miles from land. At the time of the
attack the vessel was flying the Belgian Relief
Commission&rsquo;s flag and displaying screens on both
sides, marked: &ldquo;Commission Belgian Relief,
Rotterdam,&rdquo; in letters 2½ feet high. The ship
had also been granted a safe conduct by the
German consul at the Hague. After being struck
she went down by the stern and sank in five
minutes. Seventeen of the crew, including the
master, were lost. As the ship sank, the third
officer saw the periscope of a submarine going
away to the northward.</p>

<p>The liner <i>Lusitania</i> was 30,395 tons gross
register; she carried 1,257 passengers, and a
crew of 702, making a total of 1,959 persons on
board. Of the passengers 688 were men, 440
women, and 129 children. When 11 miles from
land on the 17th May, 1915, at 2.15 p.m., the ship
was struck on the starboard side, almost simultaneously,
by two torpedoes, while a third, which
missed the ship, was fired at her port side shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>On being struck, the vessel took a heavy
list to starboard. This made it impossible
to launch the port side boats properly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
rendered it very difficult for the passengers to get
into the starboard boats, which were thrown too
far outboard. The port boats, of course, came
inboard, and some of them, catching on the rail,
were capsized.</p>

<p>Those which did reach the water were seriously
damaged and leaking. The ship sank in less
than twenty minutes after being struck, and
1,198 men, women, and children were consequently
drowned.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most effective comment upon the
destruction of the <i>Lusitania</i> may be found in
the German Naval Prize Regulations. This is
Article 116:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the destruction of a vessel, all persons
on board are to be placed in safety, with their
goods and chattels, if possible, and all ship&rsquo;s papers
and other relevant documents which, in the opinion
of the parties interested, are of value for the
decision of the Prize Court are to be taken over
by the commander.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American protest against the sinking of
the <i>Lusitania</i> was answered by the German Note
of 8th July, 1915, extracts from which are here
given:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Imperial Government learned with satisfaction
how earnestly the Government of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
United States is concerned in seeing that the
principles of humanity are realised in the present
war. This appeal also finds a ready echo in
Germany, and the Imperial Government is quite
willing to permit its statements and decisions in
the present case to be governed by the principles
of humanity, just as it has always done....
Germany has always been tenacious of the principle
that war should be conducted against the
armed and organised forces of an enemy country
but that the enemy civilian population must be
spared as far as possible from the measures of
war.... If the commander of the submarine
which destroyed the <i>Lusitania</i> had caused the
crew and passengers to take to the boats before
firing a torpedo this would have meant the certain
destruction of his own vessel.... It was to be
expected that a mighty ship like the <i>Lusitania</i>
would remain above water long enough, even
after the torpedoing of the vessel, to permit the
passengers to enter the ship&rsquo;s boats. Circumstances
of a very peculiar kind, especially the
presence on board of large quantities of highly-explosive
materials, defeated this expectation.
In addition, it may be pointed out that if the
<i>Lusitania</i> had been spared thousands of cases of
ammunition would have been sent to Germany&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
enemies, and thereby thousands of German mothers
and children would have been robbed of their
bread-winners.... The Imperial Government
will always be ready to do all it can in the present
war to prevent the jeopardising of the lives of
American citizens. The Imperial Government,
therefore, repeats its assurances that American
ships will not be hindered in the prosecution of
legitimate shipping, and that the lives of American
citizens on neutral vessels shall not be placed in
jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 1st September, 1915, Count Bernstorff
handed the following written communication to
Mr. Lansing:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Secretary</span>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In reference to our conversation of this day,
I beg to inform you that my instructions concerning
our answer to your last <i>Lusitania</i> Note
contain the following passage: &lsquo;Liners will not
be sunk by submarines without warning, and
without ensuring the safety of the lives of non-combatants,
provided that the liners do not try
to escape or offer resistance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passenger steamer <i>Arabic</i>, a vessel of 15,801
tons gross register, was outward bound to America
on the 19th August, 1915, when at 9.30 a.m. she
was torpedoed without warning, being then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
45 miles from land. She carried 176 passengers
and 261 crew, 437 in all. The submarine appears
to have been hiding behind a steamer, which had
been stopped and was then sinking. While hidden
thus, the U-boat submerged and headed for the
<i>Arabic</i>, which she torpedoed before anyone on
board had become aware of her presence. The
force of the explosion blew one of the boats into
the air and disabled the wireless telegraphy
apparatus. The ship sank in about 10 minutes.
Thanks to the good seamanship and courage of
her officers and crew, 390 persons were embarked
in the boats before the vessel went down, only
47 lives being lost. As soon as the torpedo had
been discharged the periscope of the submarine
disappeared.</p>

<p>With regard to the sinking of the <i>Arabic</i>, Count
Bernstorff sent the following communication to
Mr. Lansing:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prompted by the desire to reach a satisfactory
agreement with regard to the <i>Arabic</i>
incident, my Government has given me the
following instructions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;The orders issued by His Imperial Majesty to
the commanders of German submarines, of which I
have notified you on a previous occasion, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
made so stringent that a recurrence of incidents
similar to that of the <i>Arabic</i> case is considered out
of the question. According to the report of Commander
Schneider of the submarine which sank the
<i>Arabic</i>, Commander Schneider is convinced that the
<i>Arabic</i> intended to ram his submarine. On the other
hand, the Imperial Government does not doubt the
good faith of the affidavit of the British officers in the
<i>Arabic</i>, according to which the <i>Arabic</i> did not intend
to ram the submarine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attack of the submarine was undertaken
against the instructions issued to the commander.
The Imperial Government regrets and disavows
this act, and has notified Commander Schneider
accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In these circumstances my Government is prepared
to pay an indemnity for the American lives
which, to its deep regret, have been lost in the <i>Arabic</i>.
I am authorised to negotiate with you about the
amount of this indemnity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The statement of Commander Schneider that
he thought the <i>Arabic</i> would ram him cannot be
accepted. If it were true, the ship would have
been struck in her fore part. This, as Colonel
Concannon, of the White Star Line, has pointed
out, was not the case. The <i>Arabic</i> was struck aft.
No effort was made to ram the submarine, for it
was not seen, and no attempt was made to escape
for the same reason. No guns were mounted on
the <i>Arabic</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Ashmore</i> was a Belgian Relief ship. She
had a crew of 28 hands and was carrying a cargo
of maize from Rosario to the Belgian Relief
Commission, Rotterdam. In accordance with the
regulations agreed upon between the German
Government and the Relief Commission, the
<i>Ashmore</i> was flying flags, had two very large balls
hoisted, and the words: &ldquo;Commission for Relief
in Belgium&rdquo; painted in very large letters
on her sides.</p>

<p>On the 12th September at 8.30 a.m. the weather
was fine and clear and the sea smooth, the ship
then being about 3½ miles E. by N. from the
Kentish Knock. Most of the crew were at breakfast,
while the boatswain and chief engineer were
patrolling the after-deck. Both men were in the
act of turning round, the boatswain to starboard
and the engineer to port, when the former saw a
streak in the water at close quarters to amidships.
Before the boatswain could give the alarm a
terrible explosion took place. A volume of smoke,
coal dust and water was driven up through the
engine-room skylight and the starboard side of
the vessel, which immediately began to heel over
to starboard. The two boats were launched and
manned, but the second engineer, donkeyman,
and two firemen were never seen again, and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
have been killed by the explosion. The <i>Ashmore</i>
sank at about 9 a.m.</p>

<p>The two boats were picked up about the
same time, and the survivors were landed at
Chatham. In connection with this sinking, the
following message was sent by the American
Ambassador in London to the Secretary of State
at Washington:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;The Admiralty has confirmed to the Commission
for the Relief of Belgium the sinking of the Relief-ship
<i>Ashmore</i> yesterday. Four of the crew are
missing. The ship had a cargo of maize which the
Commission had bought afloat. The captain now in
London informs the Commission that the ship was
torpedoed, that he saw no submarine, but plainly
saw the torpedo coming towards the ship, and that
the Commission&rsquo;s signals had been put up. This is,
of course, in violation of the German Government&rsquo;s
agreement with the Commission.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>At 1.10 p.m. on the 30th December, 1915, the
s.s. <i>Persia</i> was torpedoed without warning when
40 miles from land. The second officer, in charge
on the bridge, saw the wake of an approaching
torpedo on the port bow, and a moment later
there was a violent explosion. This was followed
by a second explosion, which, in the opinion of
the chief and second officers, was caused by the
bursting of a boiler. The vessel at once listed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
over to the port side and went down in five minutes.
No boats on the starboard side could be launched
owing to the list, and several on the port side were
swamped, torn away, or capsized, owing to the
way which was still on the ship. One port-side
boat had been smashed by the explosion, another
was pressed under water by the davits, as the
ship rolled over to port. Only five boats got away,
213 of the crew and 120 passengers losing their
lives, through the explosion or by drowning. Four
over-loaded boats were adrift for 30 hours before
being picked up by a mine-sweeper. The fifth
boat, which had been damaged, capsized several
times, and contained only 11 survivors when picked
up at 8 p.m. on the 31st by another steamer.</p>

<p>The upshot of the <i>Persia</i> affair was that Count
Bernstorff submitted an official memorandum
to the United States Government, stating that
Germany proposed to conduct her submarine
campaign according to the rules of international
law. The Germans admitted that it was possible
that a German submarine sank the <i>Persia</i>, and
promised that, if this were so, the guilty captain
would be punished.</p>

<p>The <i>Euphrates</i> was a Belgium Relief ship which
left Rotterdam in January, 1917, bound for Sandy
Hook in ballast. She was provided with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
German safe conduct at Rotterdam to cover her
voyage back to the States. She flew the Belgian
flag aft, and exhibited the Relief Commission&rsquo;s
signals by day and night. In daylight these
consisted of a white square flag, bearing in the
centre the words &ldquo;Belgian Relief Commission&rdquo;
in red letters, a white pennant with the same
words in the centre, also in red letters, and a ball
painted with red and white vertical stripes above
distinguishing flags, all at the foremast. At night
the words &ldquo;Belgian s.s. <i>Euphrates</i>, Relief Commission,
Rotterdam,&rdquo; brilliantly illuminated in
large letters, extended from about amidships, on
both sides, to the stern.</p>

<p>At 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning of 22nd January,
1917, the weather was clear, with a smooth sea
and hardly any wind. A man named Somers was
on deck at the time, and swears that the ship was
displaying the daylight signals already described.
At 8.30 a violent explosion occurred, and the
ship began to sink rapidly by the stern. The
crew were ordered on deck, but a second explosion
threw them all into the sea. One boat was
smashed to pieces while afloat, the others went
down with the ship.</p>

<p>Somers and some others clung to the
smashed boat but afterwards Somers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the boatswain swam after some hatches and
managed to climb on one. At about 3 p.m.
Somers lost sight of the boatswain. At about
9.30 p.m. Somers was picked up by a boat from
the British steamer <i>Trevean</i>, which had been sunk
soon after the <i>Euphrates</i>. Some of the men in
the boat told Somers that they had seen the
Relief ship sunk, but the Germans prevented them
from rendering any assistance. Somers was the
sole survivor out of a crew of 33.</p>

<p>At the end of January, 1917, the German
Government issued its Note on the subject of
unrestricted submarine warfare. This document
pointed out that the attempt of the Central
Powers to bring about peace had failed &ldquo;on
account of the lust of conquest of their adversaries.&rdquo;
For this reason &ldquo;the Imperial Government
must now continue the war for existence
once more forced upon it by using its weapons.
The Imperial Government is, therefore, forced to
do away with the restrictions hitherto imposed
upon the use of its fighting forces at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neutral ships plying within the new barred
zones were informed that they would do so
at their own risk, although precautions would
be taken to protect neutral ships which
sailed thither prior to the 1st February. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Note to the United States, Germany declared
that she must abandon the limitations which had
hitherto governed the employment of her weapons
at sea, and added: &ldquo;Neutral ships which are
lying in harbours in the barred zones can with
security still leave the barred zones if they depart
before 5th February, and take the shortest route
to a free zone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of February, 1917, Berlin issued
an official telegram explaining that the period of
grace for neutral steamers whom news of the
blockade could not reach in time elapsed on the
night of the 12th February as regards the zone in
the Atlantic and English Channel. For the
North Sea the period of grace expired on the
night of the 6th February, and for the Mediterranean
on the night of the 10th. This telegram
concluded: &ldquo;It is expressly stated that all the
news spread from the enemy side regarding
torpedoing without previous warning of neutral
ships before the dates mentioned for the
various blockaded zones is incorrect. The
periods of grace mentioned were also in force
for enemy passenger vessels, because it was
possible that on them were neutral passengers
who were perhaps without knowledge of the sea
blockade.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Danish vessel <i>Lars Kruse</i> was a Belgian
Relief steamer, which in February, 1917, was
carrying a cargo of grain from Buenos Ayres to
Rotterdam for the Belgian Relief Commission.
She bore the neutral Commission&rsquo;s flags and markings,
as described in the case of the <i>Euphrates</i>;
and it must also be remembered that the
German authorities in the United States had
stated specifically that they did not mean to
interfere with Relief ships. Nevertheless, at
10 p.m. on the 3rd February, when 16 miles off
Ushant, the <i>Lars Kruse</i> was torpedoed without
warning, her crew of 18 being all drowned, except
the chief engineer.</p>

<p>On the 27th March, 1917, the British steamer
<i>Thracia</i> was 10 miles N.N.E. of Belle Isle, travelling
at a speed of 7 knots, the time being 8.15 p.m.
She was suddenly torpedoed without warning by
a German submarine, being struck forward of the
stokehold. The explosion burst her boilers,
killing an engineer, a greaser, and two firemen.
Immediately after the explosion the steamer went
down by the head to starboard before any attempt
could be made to lower the boats. Her crew of
38 all perished, except two men, one of whom,
Douglas V. Duff, acting fourth officer, has described
his experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Duff went down with the ship, and on coming
to the surface, swam to an upturned boat&mdash;the
starboard life-boat, which had had her stern
blown off. Seven other men clambered on to her,
two of whom had been severely wounded. Both
these men were soon washed off the boat. Three
of the remaining six slipped back into the sea, in
order to swim to a steamer which was visible
about a mile away; but a few minutes afterwards
the steamer went away. The three men did not
return. There were now two other men on the
boat besides Duff, and although he did not
actually see them go, there is no doubt that they
were both washed away by the sea.</p>

<p>At about 11 p.m. a black object came into view,
and Duff was hailed in English by the German
commander, who asked what ship he had sunk,
where she was from, and what was her destination.
Duff answered all the questions. The commander
then said, &ldquo;I am going to shoot you.&rdquo; Duff told
him to shoot away; but the commander replied
that he would not waste powder on a pig of an
Englishman, and added, &ldquo;Drown, you swine!
Drown!&rdquo; The submarine then disappeared. At
10.30 next morning Duff was picked up by a
French fishing-boat, and afterwards transferred
to a French torpedo-boat. The only other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
survivor was picked up by a Norwegian steamer,
the <i>Nordborg</i>, and landed at Barry.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 17th April the hospital
ship <i>Lanfranc</i> and s.s. <i>Donegal</i> were transporting
wounded across the Channel. The <i>Lanfranc</i>
carried 234 wounded British officers and men,
167 wounded German prisoners, a medical personnel
of 52, and a crew of 123. The s.s. <i>Donegal</i>
carried a number of slightly wounded, all of whom
were British. Between 7 and 8 p.m. both ships
were torpedoed without warning.</p>

<p>The Germans on board the <i>Lanfranc</i> at once
made a rush for the boats. They managed to
launch one, but it was overloaded and swamped.
The British soldiers stood to attention and behaved
with great coolness, as also did the medical staff
and crew. As a result of the outrage two wounded
British officers and 11 other ranks were drowned,
as well as one of the R.A.M.C. and five of the
crew. Of the Germans, two wounded officers and
13 other ranks were drowned. The casualties in
the <i>Donegal</i> amounted to 41.</p>

<p>This outrageous German crime was the sequel
to a series of accusations by the Berlin Government
to the effect that Great Britain was misusing her
hospital ships. The evidence produced by the
Germans in support of their assertions proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
to be of a flimsy and wholly untrustworthy character,
as the following examples taken from the
British Government White Paper, Miscellaneous,
No. 16 (1917), will show.</p>

<p>A man named Alexander Buttler, of Hamburg,
swore that he had sailed in the s.s. <i>Escaut</i> from
Brooklyn to La Rochelle, where he arrived about
the middle of July, 1915. There he saw a British
hospital ship being loaded with munitions from
the <i>Escaut</i>, which carried no cargo but munitions
of war: The reply of the British Government was
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;No British hospital ship was at
La Rochelle during July, 1915. All British
hospital ships have their names painted distinctly
on them in the usual place, and all fly the Red
Cross flag and the British defaced Blue Ensign
worn by transports. The credibility of the
witness may be judged from the fact that the log
of the steamship <i>Escaut</i>, on which he claims to
have been serving, shows that that vessel called
neither at La Rochelle nor at La Pallice in June,
July or August, 1915, and that she was fitted at
the time for the transport of horses. He cannot
have been in a position to know that the ship
on which he served, if his story is not entirely
fabricated, carried no cargo but munitions of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another witness is thus described by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
German Government:&mdash;&ldquo;... merchant, a
Dutch subject, living at Rotterdam,&rdquo; ...
declared that he was at Cardiff on business from
the beginning of December to the end of January,
1916. About the middle of December the hospital
ship <i>Formosa</i> arrived, was docked and took in
coal and a number of cases. On the 29th December
about 300 infantrymen in marching order
were taken on board, besides about 50 naval
officers who went on board on the 1st January,
the date of departure. He adds: &ldquo;I can confidently
assert that the soldiers and the 50 naval
officers sailed with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this the British Government replied:&mdash;&ldquo;The
witness&rsquo;s statement that the <i>Formosa</i>
arrived at Cardiff about the middle of December
is incorrect. She was at Belfast from the 16th
November to the 30th December, 1915, and did
not arrive at Cardiff till the 2nd January, 1916.
His statement that she left Cardiff in the night of
the 1st and 2nd January is therefore also incorrect.
It is, moreover, contradicted by the witness cited
by the German Government in Annex 14, who
states that the <i>Formosa</i> was still at Cardiff on the
7th January. She actually left Cardiff for the
Mediterranean on the 13th January with no
passengers on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the strength of such trumped-up
evidence as this that Germany decided to commit
the crowning inhumanity of sinking hospital
ships. In all probability, she was judging others
by her own standards, and, knowing that in
Britain&rsquo;s position she would not have hesitated
to misuse hospital ships, she came to the conclusion
that the British Government was doing
so. Her unfounded charges were denied. In a
despatch dated 5th October, 1917, Mr. Balfour
stated:&mdash;&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Government have already
issued the most categorical denial of the
assertions of the German Government that British
hospital ships have ever been used except in
accordance with the provisions of the Hague
Convention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Germany was not to be deterred
from her new path of atrocious crime, and so
we find 75 men murdered through the sinking
of the <i>Donegal</i> and the hospital ship <i>Lanfranc</i>,
15 of the victims being Germans.</p>

<p>The s.s. <i>Addah</i> left America, homeward bound,
on the 1st June, 1917. All went well until the
15th June, when a loud explosion was heard on
the port side, and the ship began to settle down
very quickly. The wireless was put out of action,
and the master gave the order to abandon ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
which was carried out with the two boats. Ten
minutes later the chief officer saw the periscope
of a submarine, and then her hull, about a point
on the starboard bow. From this position the
submarine fired several shots, hitting the vessel
seven times. She then came alongside the chief
officer&rsquo;s boat, which was entered by five Germans.
They boarded the steamer and returned with
some stores and the ensign. After they had been
rowed back to the submarine, the Germans told
the chief officer&rsquo;s boat to shove off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the master&rsquo;s boat, which had been
badly smashed by a shell, was about 350 yards
away. The submarine now opened fire with
common shrapnel, taking the stern of the master&rsquo;s
boat right off and killing eight men. Having
sunk the boat in this way, the submarine shelled
her crew as they were swimming about in the
water, still with shrapnel. Apparently under
the impression that he had wiped out the unfortunate
men, the submarine commander next
opened fire on the chief officer&rsquo;s boat. He fired
eight shrapnel shells, and succeeded in holing the
boat, breaking the oars, and slightly wounding
several men. Fortunately, no one was killed this
time. The submarine then proceeded in a northwesterly
direction on the surface. The master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and the survivors from his boat were taken on
board the chief officer&rsquo;s boat, which was eventually
picked up by a French patrol steamer on the
16th June.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th July, 1917, at
about 3 o&rsquo;clock the steamer <i>Mariston</i> was struck
by a torpedo. Just afterwards there was a second
explosion, which destroyed all the midship cabins,
and the vessel began to sink rapidly. When she
had gone down, a large black submarine came to
the surface; an officer opened a trap-door in her
conning-tower and watched the survivors struggling
in the water. The unfortunate men called
to him for help, but he ignored their appeals,
although there were no other ships in sight at the
time and he could have rescued them without any
danger to himself.</p>

<p>There were about 18 men struggling in the water,
and while the U-boat commander watched, he
saw them dragged down one after another. A
shoal of sharks had attacked them, and every
man except the cook suffered this terrible death.
Meanwhile the German had submerged, leaving
them to their fate.</p>

<p>The cook, who escaped, remained in the
water for 15 hours, being picked up by a British
merchantman at about 6.30 p.m. that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The master of the Swedish steamer <i>Vanland</i>
reports that he was attacked by a German submarine
at 6.45 p.m. on the 23rd July, 1917. He
was 4 miles from the shore at that time, and
at once made for land on a zig-zag course. The
U-boat chased him, firing continually. Seven
shells hit the hull of his vessel, and 20 hit the
deck cargo aft, while the port life-boat was carried
away and the davits of the starboard life-boat
were broken.</p>

<p>Directly the steamer took the ground her
master and crew embarked in the starboard
life-boat; but when 100 yards from their ship,
the Germans opened fire on them with a machine-gun
and wounded the second mate. The submarine
then torpedoed the <i>Vanland</i> and
submerged. Altogether 46 shells were fired by
the Germans, in addition to the machine-gun fire
directed against the life-boat.</p>

<p>At about 7.50 p.m. on Thursday, 31st July,
1917, the steamer <i>Belgian Prince</i> was travelling
at 10 knots an hour, when the wake of a torpedo
was seen upon the port beam. Her helm was at
once put hard over, but she was struck between
the after part of the engine-room and No. 5 hold.
Her main engines and also her dynamo were
disabled, so that the wireless became useless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
no S.O.S. signal could be sent out. The ship took
a very heavy list to port, and the crew proceeded
to get into their life-boats. Two of these and one
small boat were launched, and all hands were
safely embarked in them.</p>

<p>When the boats were clear of the ship a German
submarine came to the surface, and, approaching
the boats, ordered them alongside. All the officers
and crew were transferred to the submarine, the
master being taken below. The Germans were
very abusive, and, after searching their prisoners,
ordered them to take off their life-belts. These
were placed on the deck of the submarine, and
one of the German officers proceeded to throw
most of them into the sea.</p>

<p>Five German sailors now entered the small
boat and rowed her back to the <i>Belgian Prince</i>.
Other Germans entered the two life-boats, threw
the oars, balers, and gratings overboard; took
out the provisions and compasses, and then
smashed the boats with an axe.</p>

<p>The Germans who had boarded the <i>Belgian
Prince</i> now signalled to their comrades with a
flash lamp; the submarine cast off the broken
life-boats and steered away to the eastward. It
was about 9 p.m., and the crew of the <i>Belgian
Prince</i> were still standing on the deck of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
submarine, most of them without their life-belts.
The submarine stopped. Slowly she began to
sink. Then, quite suddenly, she submerged.</p>

<p>W. Snell, second cook of the <i>Belgian Prince</i>,
was standing with his shipmates, but he was more
fortunate than most of them, because he had
managed to pick up his life-belt and put it on
under his rain-coat without being observed by the
Germans. When he felt the water rising over his
feet as the submarine went down, he jumped
into the sea; and he says that his companions
did the same. Snell remained in the water all
night, and was picked up at about 7.30 a.m. next
day in a very exhausted condition.</p>

<p>Thomas Bowman, chief engineer, was also in
the water all night. He struck out in the direction
of the <i>Belgian Prince</i> and at daylight next
morning he sighted her still afloat. At about
5.30 a.m. he saw her explode and go down. An
hour later he was picked up by a British patrol-boat.</p>

<p>George Silessi, A.B., was the only other survivor
out of a crew of 42.</p>

<p>Such are the circumstances that accompanied
the sinking of the <i>Belgian Prince</i>, and one looks
in vain for any fact that can excuse the conduct
of the Germans. They appear to have carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
out their work with the sole object of taking as
many lives as possible. To understand the
out-look of such men is impossible. What was
at the back of their minds when they dismantled
and destroyed the life-boats? What satisfaction
could they derive from the fact that their prisoners
had no life-belts? These belts, it will be noticed,
were thrown overboard by a German <i>officer</i>.
What is to be said of the submarine commander
who allowed such conduct? Here was a responsible
officer who ordered his craft to submerge,
when he knew perfectly well that most of the
38 men outside on deck were without any means
of saving their lives. Imagination boggles at
the cold-blooded cruelty of the deed.</p>

THE PIRATE AND NEUTRALS.</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The German soul is God&rsquo;s soul: it shall and will
rule over mankind.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pastor W. Lehmann.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The German Naval Prize Regulations
naturally contain instructions for the
guidance of German naval officers whose
duty brings them into contact with neutral
shipping. Thus, Article 81 directs that&mdash;&ldquo;In
stopping and searching a vessel under a
neutral flag the commander must avoid, as far as
possible, diverting her from her route. He will
in general endeavour to cause the vessel as little
inconvenience as possible. Especially in no
circumstances may he require the master to come
on board the warship or to send a boat, members
of the crew, the ship&rsquo;s papers, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here is Article 82:&mdash;&ldquo;If the commander wishes
to stop a ship he must summon her to stop by
signal and by sounding the siren. At the latest,
ensign and pendant are to be shown simultaneously
with this signal; by night the ensign is
to be illuminated. During the chase it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
necessary to show the war flag, any mercantile
flag may be flown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Article 113 states that&mdash;&ldquo;A commander is only
justified in destroying a neutral ship ... for
carrying contraband ... for breach of blockade,
or for unneutral service&rdquo; if bringing her into port
&ldquo;might expose the warship to danger or imperil
the success of the operations in which she is
engaged at the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Germany&rsquo;s outrageous conduct with regard to
neutral shipping dates back to 1915. Indeed,
a book could be filled entirely with instances
similar to the small selection here collected.
German regulations, international law, and the
dictates of common humanity have been freely
disregarded by the German submarine service
almost from the beginning of the war. There can
be no doubt that the Imperial German Government
speaks with one voice to the world and with
another voice to its submariners, whose deeds
show what kind of orders they receive from Berlin.</p>

<p>The Portuguese steamship <i>Douro</i> was bound for
Oporto on the 3rd April, 1915, when at 3 p.m. she
was torpedoed without warning. She began to
sink rapidly, and at 4.30 p.m. the master and
crew left the ship in their life-boat. Half-an-hour
later the <i>Douro</i> went down. At 9 a.m. next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the life-boat reached Helwick Lightship, and at
4 p.m. that day the master and crew were taken
off by the steamer <i>Tudwall</i> and brought to Swansea.</p>

<p>On the 14th April, 1915, the Swedish steamer
<i>Folke</i> was 52 miles from Peterhead at 10 p.m.,
<i>en route</i> to Farne Island from Stavanger. Suddenly
there was a big explosion under the stern of the
ship; the propeller was blown off; and wooden
pit-props in the cargo were sent flying through
the air in all directions. The crew took to the
boats, and after leaving the ship, the master,
Captain Ohlssen, heard the noise of a submarine&rsquo;s
motor twice, first on one side of his boat, then
on the other. He recognised the sound, having
on several previous occasions seen submarines
under way. The <i>Folke</i> remained afloat for about
2½ hours. There were no casualties.</p>

<p>On the 15th April, 1915, the Dutch steamer
<i>Katwijk</i>, while on voyage from Baltimore to
Rotterdam, was torpedoed by a German submarine.
She carried a cargo of grain for the
Dutch Government, and was lying at anchor
7 miles west of the North Hinder at the time of the
outrage. A fire broke out soon after the explosion
of the torpedo, and the vessel sank in 20 minutes.
There were no casualties.</p>

<p>On the 19th April, our Minister at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Hague sent the following message to the
British Foreign Office: &ldquo;Minister for Foreign
Affairs told French Minister to-day that
German Foreign Office admitted to Netherlands
Minister at Berlin that it was a German
submarine which sank the <i>Katwijk</i>, and added
that it was an unfortunate accident.&rdquo; On the
20th April the German Government informed
the Netherlands Minister that they would make
enquiries, and, if proved that it was a German
submarine, they would express their regret and
indemnify the Netherlands Government for their
loss. On the very same day, 20th April, the
following was included in the German official
wireless news: &ldquo;The special Rotterdam correspondent
of the <i>Deutsche Tageszeitung</i> reports that
the description of the boat which torpedoed the
<i>Katwijk</i>, and the behaviour of the crew, lead one
to believe that the vessel was of English nationality.&rdquo;
On the 10th May our Minister at the
Hague communicated this message to the British
Foreign Office: &ldquo;Netherlands Minister for
Foreign Affairs tells me that he has just heard
from Berlin that German Government acknowledge
that <i>Katwijk</i> was torpedoed by a German
submarine. German Government fully apologise
for the mistake and promise an ample indemnity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems probable that the German Government
had a shrewd suspicion that it was one of their
own submarines which sank the <i>Katwijk</i>, even as
early as the 19th April. However, this did not
prevent them from sending out broadcast in their
official wireless news on the 20th a strong
suggestion that a British submarine was responsible&mdash;a
little illustration of German official
methods.</p>

<p>The American oil-tank steamer <i>Gulflight</i> was
torpedoed without warning off the Scilly Islands
at 12.50 p.m. on the 2nd May, 1915. One seaman
and the wireless operator were drowned, while
the master died soon afterwards from shock. The
remaining 35 members of the crew were saved.
The submarine remained on the surface for three
minutes after discharging the first torpedo; then
submerged, and 25 minutes later struck the vessel
with a second torpedo.</p>

<p>On the 25th May, 1915, the American steamer
<i>Nebraskan</i> was 50 miles W.S.W. from the Fastnet
Rock. The sea was smooth and the weather
calm, but at about 9 p.m. she was torpedoed
without warning by a German submarine. The
crew took to their boats and, after standing by the
ship for an hour, returned on board, and at 10.30
started for Liverpool. At about 1.25 a.m. they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
met with two vessels sent by the British Admiralty
in answer to a wireless call, and Liverpool was
reached in safety.</p>

<p>The <i>Betty</i> was a Danish schooner, carrying a
cargo of coal and coke to Copenhagen. At noon
on the 25th May, 1915, in fine weather, when
132 miles from the Farne Islands, a torpedo was
seen rapidly approaching the ship. She was
struck between No. 3 hold and the engine-room
on the port side, after which no further sign of the
submarine was seen. The <i>Betty</i> listed heavily to
port; both life-boats were swung out and manned.
While the boats were standing by, a Swedish
vessel, the <i>Waldemar</i>, of Stockholm, appeared on
the scene and picked up the crew.</p>

<p>The <i>Svein Jarl</i> was a Norwegian steamship,
which on the 9th June, 1915, was on a voyage from
Warkworth to a port in East Finmark. Suddenly
a submarine bearing no flag or sign of nationality
was seen approaching at full speed. The submarine
turned sharply, and a few moments later
the steamer was struck by a torpedo. The force
of the explosion threw the crew into the sea, their
ship going down within 30 seconds. A Dutch
fishing-boat picked up the master and three men
and landed them five days later at Scheveningen;
but 12 of the crew were lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The Norwegian steamer <i>Rym</i> was torpedoed
without warning by a German submarine at
7.26 p.m. on the 14th July, 1915, the weather
being fine and clear, with a choppy sea. The
master had just gone below when an explosion
occurred which knocked him senseless for several
moments. The second engineer was killed in
the engine-room, and the ship sank in three
minutes. The mate saw the periscope of a submarine
immediately after the explosion.</p>

<p>On the 18th August, 1915, the Norwegian
schooner <i>Magda</i> was torpedoed by a German
submarine without warning. It was 11.35 p.m.,
the weather being fine. The ship had the Norwegian
flag painted on her sides, which were
brilliantly illuminated. A torpedo was suddenly
seen coming towards the ship, which was struck
just afterwards on the starboard side. After the
explosion the <i>Magda</i> began to go down by the
head, and the crew took to their boats. They
were lucky enough to be picked up 20 minutes
afterwards without casualty.</p>

<p>The Dutch steamer <i>Tubantia</i> was 4 miles west
of the North Hinder on the evening of the 16th
March, 1916. The ship was brilliantly lighted;
two arc lamps projected beyond her sides, illuminating
her name, which was painted on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
side in large letters. Two more lamps threw their
light over the name on the stern of the vessel;
while between her funnels an illuminated nameboard
was suspended. There could be no possible
doubt as to the identity and nationality of the
<i>Tubantia</i>; but, all the same, she was torpedoed
that night by a German submarine.</p>

<p>The Germans attempted to evade responsibility
for the deed. On the 17th March Berlin sent this
message to the German Embassy at Washington:
&ldquo;English mines, on account of their construction,
frequently get loose and float, and, that being so,
<i>Tubantia</i> most certainly struck and destroyed by
English mine.&rdquo; Unfortunately for Berlin, pieces
of metal were found in two of the steamer&rsquo;s boats,
and these, the German Government were bound to
admit, belonged to a German torpedo. A new
official story was accordingly concocted by Berlin.
In June the <i>North German Gazette</i> published the
result of the German official investigation into
the sinking of the <i>Tubantia</i>. The gist of the
finding was that the <i>Tubantia</i> had been sunk by
a floating German torpedo, which had been fired
at and missed a British destroyer 10 days before.</p>

<p>To make this yarn more plausible, it was stated
that the British destroyer had three funnels, that
she was in company with two other destroyers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
that there was a British submarine in the neighbourhood.
To explain away the illegal use of
torpedoes which float for 10 days after being
discharged, it was pointed out that this might
happen through some flaw in construction. Out of
this cock-and-bull story one fact at least emerged
clearly enough, namely, that the Dutch steamer
had been destroyed by a German torpedo.</p>

<p>A Court of Enquiry was held in Holland, at
which the evidence was carefully sifted. At this
court both the fourth mate and the man in the
crow&rsquo;s nest swore to having seen the track of a
torpedo coming towards the ship before she was
struck. The court&rsquo;s verdict was: &ldquo;The evidence
given by the said witnesses and experts, considered
in all its bearings, proves that the
explosion was caused by a torpedo, which at
some distance, under an angle of six points, was
launched by a torpedo-boat or a submarine,
without any previous warning. This torpedo
appears to have been a bronze Schwarzkopf
torpedo, and was aimed at the <i>Tubantia</i>, there
being no other ship near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that the wake of a torpedo approaching
the ship was seen by two men in the steamer
proves that the German explanation about a
floating torpedo was false. A floating torpedo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
would, of course, make no track in the water.
The whole case is a further exposure of
German methods.</p>

<p>On the 3rd February the Norwegian sailing
vessel <i>Tamara</i> fell in with a German submarine
at 9.30 a.m. Although flying the Norwegian
colours and bearing the name of the ship and her
country painted on her side, this vessel was sunk
by the U-boat. Before sinking her, the Germans
searched the ship and carried away everything
portable, including the clothes of the crew. The
boats were picked up at 10 p.m. by a patrol vessel.</p>

<p>The Norwegian steamer <i>Solbakken</i> was sunk by
a German submarine off Finisterre on the 4th
February, 1917. One man was drowned and one
died of the cold. Thirteen survivors were landed
at Gijon.</p>

<p>A German submarine sighted the Peruvian
barque <i>Lorton</i> on the 5th February, 1917, and at
once opened fire at 3,000 yards. The Peruvian
colours were hoisted, the ship was hove to, and
the master proceeded in his boat to the submarine.
He was questioned by a young officer
who spoke very good English, and who seemed
to know all about the <i>Lorton</i>. This officer told
the master to return to his ship and bring back a
German who was on board. Five of the sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>marine&rsquo;s
crew went back with him, and they
found the German mate of the <i>Lorton</i> with his
things all packed ready to be taken off. The
Germans took the master&rsquo;s watch, refused to
return his papers, and sank his ship. The master
is of opinion that his German mate had given
certain information about the movements of the
ship. The man sent a letter off from Colon.</p>

<p>On the 7th February the Swedish steamship
<i>Varing</i>, bound from Savannah to Helsingborg,
met with a German submarine. Although the
steamer was hove to and hoisted the Swedish flag,
the submarine continued firing for 20 minutes,
her master counting 20 shells in that period. Her
crew were allowed no time to save their personal
belongings or to furnish the life-boats with
provisions. The master made a strong protest
against the methods of the submarine commander
when he reached Helsingborg.</p>

<p>In fine weather and a calm sea the Greek steamship
<i>Aghios Spyridon</i> was sunk without warning
by a submerged U-boat at 1.5 a.m. on the 12th
February, 1917. The vessel sank in a few seconds
after being torpedoed, and the crew had but little
chance of escape. Out of 21 men, 16 were lost,
one Chilian and one Spaniard being amongst the
killed. The survivors, who clung to floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
wreckage, were eventually picked up by a patrol-boat
and landed at Penzance.</p>

<p>The Norwegian vessel <i>Falls of Afton</i> was at
sea on the 20th February, 1917, with the Norwegian
colours painted on her side. At nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, in hazy weather, a German
submarine rose to the surface right ahead of the
ship, waited till the vessel approached, then
steered to starboard and lay about 4 cables distant.
No other vessel was in sight. The Norwegian
colours were hoisted, but the submarine fired three
shots, one of which went through a sail. The
ship was hove to and was abandoned by her
crew, the Germans sinking her with bombs. No
lives were lost, but a member of the crew, who had
signed on as a Russian Finn, declared himself a
German and was taken away in the submarine.</p>

<p>The Norwegian sailing vessel <i>Mabella</i> was sunk
by a U-boat on the 1st March, 1917, although
the Norwegian colours and ship&rsquo;s name were
hoisted directly the submarine was sighted. The
vessel was sunk by gun-fire and two bombs. The
Germans took the master&rsquo;s chronometer, sextant,
new oilskin coat, and three bags of stores.</p>

<p>On the same date the Norwegian steamer
<i>Gurre</i> was torpedoed without warning, and sank
in 30 seconds. Only three men were saved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
among the drowned were two British ladies from
Christiania.</p>

<p>The Danish steamer <i>Rosborg</i> was bound for
Esbjerg from Baltimore with a cargo of 2,600
tons of maize for Eriksen and Christiensen. She
was a neutral ship, flying neutral colours, but on
the 3rd March, 1917, she was sunk by a German
submarine.</p>

<p>The Norwegian sailing vessel <i>Silas</i> was sunk
by a German submarine at 11.30 a.m. on the 8th
March. The crew were given half-an-hour to get
the boats clear, and there were no casualties.</p>

<p>At noon on the 12th March the Norwegian
steamer <i>Einar Jarl</i> came under fire from a German
submarine. A shell went through her coal-bunker
and exploded, and while the boats were lowered
the fire was continued. While the master was
getting into the starboard boat a shell exploded,
striking him in the shoulder, severely wounding
two men, and putting 17 holes through his boat.
About 20 shells were fired altogether, five of
which hit the ship or boats. The crew were
eventually picked up by a drifter.</p>

<p>The Norwegian sailing vessel <i>Collingwood</i> was
sunk on the same day, and in the opinion of her
skipper the submarine commander and part of
his crew were drunk. It is probable that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
obtained champagne and cognac from the French
ship <i>Jules Gommes</i>, which they had sunk about
two hours before. At any rate, they refused to
examine the <i>Collingwood&rsquo;s</i> papers, although the
skipper protested strongly, explaining that his
ship was bound for Christiania. The vessel was
sunk by bombs, and the crew were in their boats
from 2.30 p.m. on the 12th March until 3 p.m. on
the 15th March, when they were picked up and
brought into Penzance.</p>

<p>On the 9th June, 1917, the Danish steamer
<i>Dana</i> was sunk by a U-boat. She was abandoned
at 3.30 p.m., four men being lost.</p>

<p>The master of the Norwegian steamer <i>Helma</i>,
of Bergen, took his vessel to sea on the 12th June,
1917, and proceeded without misadventure until
the 24th June, when a submarine opened fire on
him. Boats were lowered, and the master rowed
alongside the submarine. The Germans boarded
this boat, threw her sails and gear overboard, and
then proceeded to the <i>Helma</i>, returning with the
ship&rsquo;s provisions and papers. The <i>Helma</i> was
sunk by bombs, and the Norwegians were turned
adrift with hardly any provisions and no sails
or gear. They remained at sea for three days
before reaching safety.</p>

WHAT IS THE VERDICT?</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>The German Government attaches no less importance
to the sacred principles of humanity than the Government
of the United States.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Can anything be said in extenuation of the
German submariner?</p>

<p>Germany declares that she is fighting for her
existence, and that unrestricted U-boat warfare
is a necessity. Adopting for a moment the
enemy&rsquo;s point of view, we are still entitled to ask
two questions, which can be answered by anyone
who knows what has taken place.</p>

<p>In the first place, even if the necessity of unrestricted
submarine warfare should be admitted,
must it be attended by acts of savagery? Secondly,
when a nation fights for its existence, is there
any standard by which it can be judged, or does
it stand outside all law, whether human or divine?</p>

<p>The exploits described in this book provide
Germany&rsquo;s answer to both these questions.
That is why she stands condemned before the
eyes of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The German submarine commanders have proved
by their deeds that they commit excesses from
sheer love of cruelty, and not from any national
necessity. Over and over again they have shelled
defenceless seamen while abandoning ship, disregarded
drowning men when rescue would have
been easy, sunk ships at sight when a few minutes&rsquo;
grace would have meant the saving of many lives.
The security of Germany demanded none of these
deeds. It is possible to carry out submarine
warfare without barbarity; but the German
submarine service appears deliberately to have
chosen the methods of the barbarian.</p>

<p>Another damning point in the evidence here
collected is that it stamps the whole German
submarine service. The excesses described
are not mere exceptions to the general rule
of German submarine methods. They could be
multiplied almost indefinitely; they cover every
ocean in which the German U-boats have appeared;
and they are not recent developments of sea-frightfulness,
for they date back almost to the
beginning of the war.</p>

<p>We have attempted to judge Germany by her
own standards as far as possible, but the difficulty
is to fix any standard upon which she orders
her actions. The conclusion is irresistible. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
German submarine commander stands convicted
upon evidence unassailable as a thief, a murderer,
and a barbarian. If it could be argued that by
committing these acts he was performing his work
more efficiently, criticism would be to some extent
disarmed; but no single ship went to the bottom
more completely on account of the outrages of the
U-boat commander who was responsible for her
sinking. The acts of these men were mere asides,
something in the nature of recreation to relieve
the monotony of the submariner&rsquo;s life. The
impartial mind cannot escape from this
conclusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, behind the sinister figure of the
U-boat commander rises up the grim outline of
the faithless Imperial German Government. This
is the Government that declared she would not
molest Belgian Relief ships, and then sent the
<i>Harpalyce</i>, <i>Ashmore</i>, and <i>Euphrates</i> to the bottom
without warning. This is the Government which
has often declared that she respected the rights
of neutrals, but has behaved to neutral shipping
as a pirate denying all rights to others.</p>

<p>Finally, what of the possibilities opened up by
the system under which the German <i>Chargé
d&rsquo;Affaires</i> at Buenos Ayres communicated with
the Foreign Office in Berlin, sending cypher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
telegrams which passed as Swedish official messages?
&ldquo;I beg that the small steamers <i>Oran</i> and
<i>Guazo</i>, now nearing Bordeaux, may be spared,
or else sunk without a trace being left,&rdquo; he telegraphed
on the 19th May, 1917. Precise information
as to the position, cargo, and destination of
a vessel often reaches the U-boat commander,
and more than one very suggestive instance of
this appears in these pages. On such an occasion,
after the submarine has appeared, a certain
member of the steamer&rsquo;s crew announces that
he is a German, and the U-boat commander takes
the spy away with him. These sailor-spies sign
on under the cloak of some neutral nationality.</p>

<p>Surely the members of the German Submarine
Service stand convicted by their own deeds as
unscrupulous pirates, with whom even savages
might well hesitate to claim any fellowship.
The verdict of civilised humanity has been pronounced
against these men who have destroyed
the Brotherhood of the Sea and horrified
Civilisation.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
